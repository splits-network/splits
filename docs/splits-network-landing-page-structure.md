- Primary CTA:
  - “Join as a Recruiter”

## 7. How Money Flows – The Split Model

**Visual:**

- Simple horizontal or vertical diagram:
  - `Company → Placement Fee → Splits Network → Recruiter`
- Optional numbers example:
  - “Candidate salary: $120,000”
  - “Placement fee (20%): $24,000”
  - “Platform share: $X,XXX”
  - “Recruiter share: $Y,YYY”

Reassure both sides:
- “Clear terms. No surprise clawbacks from the platform.”

## 10. Pricing Snapshot

Key messaging:

- “Companies pay on hire. Recruiters choose a subscription level that matches their ambition.”

**Purpose:** Address common objections and confusion up front.

Example FAQ questions:

1. “How do splits actually work on Splits Network?”
2. “Who owns the candidate and relationship?”
3. “How do payouts work today? Is Splits Network handling the money or just tracking it?”
4. “Can I bring my existing companies/recruiters onto the platform?”
5. “What does it cost for recruiters? What does it cost for companies?”
6. “Do I have to switch away from my current ATS?”

Answers should be short, direct, and honest; detailed operational policies can live on a separate page later.

---

## 13. Final CTA / Closing Block

**Purpose:** Reiterate the core value and give clear next steps for both primary personas.

**Copy ideas:**

- Headline:
  - “Ready to run your split deals on rails?”
- Subheadline:
  - “Stop juggling spreadsheets and side email threads. Give your split placements a proper home.”

**Dual CTAs:**

Short closing line:
- “Splits Network is for people who believe in fair, transparent, and scalable recruiting partnerships.”

## 14. Implementation Notes

- This structure maps cleanly into a single-page layout for `apps/marketing/app/page.tsx` using:
  - Hero section at top.
  - “How it works” and “Why different” near fold.
  - Persona-focused sections (Recruiters / Companies) mid-page.
  - Product screenshots around the center.
  - Money flow & features as deeper scroll content.
  - FAQ + final CTA at the bottom.
- DaisyUI components that fit well:
  - `hero`, `stats`, `card`, `steps`, `tabs`, `collapse` (for FAQ), `btn`.
- Ensure all CTAs steer clearly into either recruiter onboarding or company intake, depending on the button.

This gives the landing page a clear story arc: **What it is → How it works → Why it’s different → Is this for you → What it costs → Questions → Join.**
