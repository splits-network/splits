# Splits Network – Detailed Explanation & Copy Guidance

This document provides the “why” and how-to-talk-about-it guidance so the product feels trustworthy to candidates and practical to recruiters/companies.

---

## 1. Purpose
Splits Network is a deal engine for recruiting:
- Origination matters (candidate and company)
- Execution matters (closer, specs, client)
- The platform enforces attribution, reduces chaos, and pays deterministically

---

## 2. Draft + Assessment (Why)
- Candidates submit incomplete info
- Recruiters waste time
- Companies lose trust

Draft + assessment:
- improves completeness
- increases hire probability
- reduces review load

AI is assistive. Humans decide.

## 3. Hybrid Sourcer Incentive (How to explain)
Positioning:
- “Everyone earns the base discovery/origination rate.”
- “Paid plans earn an additional bonus.”

Avoid penalty framing.

---

## 4. Candidate copy rules
Avoid:
- splits, commission, deal language
Prefer:
- representation, submission, status, next steps

Examples:
- “We’re preparing your application to match the role requirements.”
- “We need a bit more info before we can submit you.”

---

## 5. Recruiter copy rules
Be explicit:
- “6% base + 2% Pro bonus = 8%”
- “Rate snapshotted at hire (immutable)”
