# Splits Network – Phase 2 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Phase 2 focuses on **network depth, trust, leverage, and scalability**.

Phase 1 proved the core loop:
- Roles enter the system.
- Recruiters submit candidates.
- Companies hire.
- Placements and splits are tracked.

Phase 2 turns Splits Network from “a solid recruiting platform” into **a true recruiting marketplace with compounding value**.

## 1. Phase 2 Objectives

Primary goals for Phase 2:

1. Increase **network value** (more reasons to stay and grow inside Splits).
2. Improve **trust and transparency** between recruiters and companies.
3. Enable **collaboration and leverage** between recruiters.
4. Lay groundwork for **automation, reputation, and AI assistance**.
5. Prepare the platform for **higher volume and higher-value placements**.

Phase 2 assumes Phase 1 is stable, live, and already used by real recruiters and companies.

Phase 2 work aligns around five themes:
