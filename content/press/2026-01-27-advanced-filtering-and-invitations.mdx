Today's release makes it dramatically easier to find what you're looking for. Advanced filtering for roles and candidates, a new candidate browsing experience, and invitation management put you in control of your recruiting pipeline.

## New Features

### Advanced Role and Candidate Filtering

You can now filter the Browse Roles and Browse Candidates views with multiple criteria simultaneously. Search by location, salary range, industry, experience level, and more. Combine filters to narrow results down to exactly the candidates or roles that match your needs. Filters are applied instantly, so you can refine your search in real time.

### Candidate Browsing and Detail Views

A complete candidate browsing experience is now available. Browse candidate profiles, view detailed information, and take action, all from a unified interface. Each candidate detail page shows their background, skills, availability, and current application status, giving you everything you need to decide whether to reach out.

### Invitation Management

You can now send invitations to candidates and track their status through the full lifecycle. See which invitations are pending, accepted, or declined. View invitation details including when they were sent and any associated notes. This gives recruiters a clear picture of their outreach pipeline alongside their active candidates.

### Recruiter Subscription Management

A new subscription section in the recruiter profile makes it easy to view and manage your current plan. See your subscription status, billing cycle, and plan details without navigating to a separate billing page.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Company and Recruiter Onboarding

The onboarding wizard for both companies and recruiters has been improved with richer form fields and better guidance at each step. Company info collection is more thorough, and recruiter profile setup captures the details that matter for marketplace visibility.

### Updated Navigation

The sidebar navigation has been updated with clearer labels and a reorganized structure. Deprecated sections are clearly marked, making it easy to find the current tools while legacy features are phased out.
