Today's release is packed with features that strengthen the connection between recruiters, companies, and candidates. From recruiter management tools to a comprehensive email notification system, every participant in the hiring process stays better informed.

## New Features

### Recruiter Management

Companies now have dedicated tools for managing their recruiter relationships. View your connected recruiters, manage partnership terms, and track performance, all from a centralized management interface.

### Batch Profile Updates

You can now save changes to your profile and marketplace settings in a single action. Previously, updating multiple sections required saving each one individually. Batch saving means fewer clicks and a faster setup experience when configuring your account.

### Company Document Uploads

Companies can now upload supporting documents directly to applications. Whether it's an offer letter, job description addendum, or onboarding paperwork, you can attach files at the application level. This keeps all relevant documents in one place, tied to the candidate record.

### Comprehensive Email Notifications

We've launched a complete set of email notifications covering every critical moment in the hiring pipeline:

- **Recruiter review complete** -- get notified when a recruiter finishes evaluating a candidate
- **Company review complete** -- know immediately when the hiring company has reviewed your submission
- **Feedback received** -- candidates and recruiters are alerted when feedback is posted
- **AI review ready** -- receive an email when the AI fit analysis is available for a candidate
- **Application expiring** -- get a heads-up before an application window closes, so nothing falls through the cracks

Each notification includes relevant context so you can take action directly from your inbox.

### Enhanced Candidate Notifications

Candidate email notifications now include recruiter details, so candidates know exactly who is working on their behalf. This builds trust and keeps communication lines clear.

### Marketplace Profile: Specialties and Industries

Your marketplace profile now supports specialties and industries. Recruiters can tag their areas of expertise, making it easier for companies to find the right recruiting partner for specific roles. Companies can filter recruiters by specialty when browsing the marketplace.

### Salary Input for Hire Transitions

When advancing a candidate to the hire stage, you can now enter the agreed salary directly in the transition workflow. This captures compensation data at the point of decision, ensuring accurate records for placement tracking and payout calculations.

## Improvements

### Streamlined Authentication Flow

The sign-up experience now routes you to the right dashboard immediately after account creation. Semi-public routes are handled more intelligently, so you see the right content whether you're logged in or browsing publicly.

### Updated Application Actions

Action buttons throughout the application workflow have been refreshed with clearer labels and more intuitive placement. Taking the next step on a candidate, whether it's advancing, rejecting, or requesting information, is more straightforward.
