Today's release focuses on accessibility, mobile usability, and navigation consistency. Forms are more accessible, the sidebar works on smaller screens, and recruiters get an improved dashboard experience.

## New Features

### Mobile-Compatible Sidebar

The portal layout and sidebar have been updated for mobile compatibility. You can now navigate the full platform from your phone or tablet with a responsive sidebar that adapts to smaller screens. Role display has also been improved to show your current context clearly on any device.

### Enhanced Recruiter Dashboard

The recruiter dashboard has been upgraded with improved candidate tables that display richer information at a glance. Candidate pagination and filtering logic have been refined, so large candidate pools load faster and you can narrow results more effectively.

### Relationship Dates and Status Tracking

When creating or updating recruiter-candidate relationships, the platform now records relationship dates and status information. You can see when a connection was established and track how the relationship has evolved over time.

## Improvements

### Accessible Form Controls

All form controls across the platform have been migrated to use semantic fieldset and legend elements. This improves screen reader compatibility and makes forms more navigable for users relying on assistive technology. The visual appearance remains the same, but the underlying structure is significantly more accessible.

### Consistent Navigation Paths

Links across the portal, including dashboard, document, invitation, and application pages, have been standardized to use consistent routing paths. Bookmarks, shared links, and browser history all work reliably. Email templates have also been updated so that every link in a notification email takes you to the correct page.

### Improved Document and Role Handling

Document access and role-based controls have been tightened. API request parameters are now validated more strictly, ensuring that document retrieval and candidate access respect your current role and permissions.
