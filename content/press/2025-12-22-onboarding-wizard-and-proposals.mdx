Today's release focuses on first impressions and recruiter workflows, with a guided onboarding experience for new users and a complete job proposal feature for recruiters.

## New Features

### Guided Onboarding Wizard

New users are now greeted by a multi-step onboarding wizard that walks them through setting up their account. Recruiters are prompted to fill in profile details, specializations, and organization information. Company administrators provide company details, and the system tailors the setup flow to each role. Platform administrators skip onboarding entirely since they already have full access. Once complete, your onboarding status is saved so you will never see the wizard again.

### Recruiter Job Proposals

Recruiters can now propose candidates for specific jobs through a structured proposal workflow. Browse available roles, select a candidate from your network, and submit a proposal with supporting details. Hiring companies receive the proposal and can review, accept, or decline it directly within the platform. This replaces informal outreach with a trackable, transparent process that benefits both sides.

### Enhanced Company Record Creation

When company administrators sign up and create their organization, the platform now captures additional company details during the process. This means richer company profiles from day one, giving recruiters more context when evaluating whether to work with a hiring company.

## Improvements

### Streamlined Navigation

The header navigation has been simplified. The separate settings link has been removed in favor of a direct profile link, reducing the number of clicks needed to manage your account.

### Improved Sign-Up Verification

The sign-up verification form has been cleaned up for a smoother experience, with clearer input fields and better visual structure during the email verification step.

### User Role Assignment Fixes

Role assignments during sign-up now apply correctly in all cases, ensuring new users land in the right experience from their very first session.
