Today's release consolidates the proposals experience and improves how the platform routes recruiter and application data behind the scenes.

## New Features

### Unified Proposals System

Recruiters now have a single, consolidated view of all their proposals. Whether you proposed a candidate for a job or a hiring company invited you to fill a role, everything appears in one place with consistent status tracking, filtering, and detail views. A new endpoint lets recruiters fetch all jobs they have been proposed for, making it easy to see your full opportunity pipeline at a glance.

## Improvements

### Smarter Recruiter and Application Routing

The platform now resolves recruiter identities and application records more reliably across every workflow. When you navigate to a recruiter profile, application detail, or proposal, the system correctly maps your user account to the right entity regardless of how you arrived there. This eliminates edge cases where records could display incorrectly when accessed through different paths.
