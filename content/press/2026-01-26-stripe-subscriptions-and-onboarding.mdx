Today's release brings self-service billing to recruiters and makes the onboarding process more resilient. Subscribe to the plan that fits your needs and get started faster, no matter how you sign up.

## New Features

### Recruiter Subscription Plans

You can now subscribe to a paid plan directly from the platform. The new subscription flow is powered by Stripe, giving you a secure, familiar checkout experience. Choose your plan, enter payment details, and you're upgraded instantly. Your subscription status is visible in your account settings, and you can manage billing at any time.

### Dynamic Page Titles

The portal header now displays a dynamic page title that updates as you navigate. Whether you're on the dashboard, reviewing applications, or managing settings, the header reflects exactly where you are. This is a small but meaningful usability improvement, especially when you have multiple tabs open.

## Improvements

### SSO Onboarding Fallback

If you sign up using Google or another SSO provider, the platform now automatically creates your account even if the initial registration step was skipped. Previously, SSO sign-ups could occasionally land in a state where the account existed in the authentication system but not in the platform. This fallback ensures a smooth experience regardless of how you create your account.

### Improved Error Handling for Authentication

Sign-in and SSO callback flows now handle edge cases more gracefully. If something goes wrong during authentication, you'll see a clear message explaining what happened and how to proceed, rather than a generic error screen.
