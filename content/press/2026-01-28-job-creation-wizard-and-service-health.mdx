Today's release introduces two features that make the platform easier to use and more transparent: a guided job creation wizard and real-time service health monitoring.

## New Features

### Job Creation Wizard

Creating a new job listing is now a guided, multi-step experience. The wizard walks you through each section:

1. **Job Details** -- title, location, employment type, and other core information
2. **Compensation** -- salary range, bonus structure, and benefits
3. **Description** -- role overview, responsibilities, and what makes the position attractive
4. **Requirements** -- qualifications, experience levels, and must-have skills
5. **Pre-Screen Questions** -- custom questions candidates answer before applying

Each step validates your input as you go, so you catch issues early rather than at the end. You can navigate back and forth between steps without losing progress. The result is a more complete, higher-quality job listing that attracts better candidates.

### Role Creation Wizard

A complementary role creation wizard is also available as a modal, letting you quickly spin up a new role from anywhere in the platform without navigating away from your current page. The same multi-step flow ensures consistency and completeness.

### Service Health Banner

A new banner at the top of the platform alerts you when any service is experiencing issues. Instead of wondering why something isn't loading or responding slowly, you'll see a clear status message explaining the situation. When everything is running normally, the banner stays hidden, keeping your workspace clean.

### Onboarding State Persistence

Your progress in the onboarding wizard is now saved to your account. If you close the browser or switch devices mid-setup, you'll pick up right where you left off. No more re-entering information because your session expired.
