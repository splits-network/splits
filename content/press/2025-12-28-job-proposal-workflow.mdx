Today's release delivers the full job proposal pipeline, connecting recruiters, candidates, and hiring companies through a structured workflow with built-in safeguards.

## New Features

### Job Proposal Workflow

Recruiters can now propose candidates for specific jobs through a guided workflow. The system walks you through selecting a candidate, confirming details, and submitting the proposal. Everything is tracked from submission through to the hiring company's response, giving you clear visibility into where each proposal stands.

### Consent-Based Candidate Sourcing

Before a recruiter can assign a candidate to a role, the platform now verifies that the candidate has given consent. This protects candidate privacy and ensures compliance with sourcing best practices. No proposal moves forward without explicit candidate agreement.

### Candidate Invitation Emails

When a candidate is invited to participate in a placement, they now receive a detailed notification email. The email includes the recruiter's information and context about the opportunity, so candidates can make informed decisions about whether to engage.

### Enriched Recruiter Profiles

Recruiter profiles now display richer information by pulling in user details alongside network data. When a hiring company reviews a proposal, they see a more complete picture of who the recruiter is, including their background and credentials.

## Improvements

### Improved Email Validation

The notification system now validates email addresses more thoroughly before sending. This catches formatting issues and invalid addresses early, ensuring that important communications actually reach their recipients.

### Better Proposal Logging

The platform now logs key events throughout the proposal lifecycle in more detail. If something goes wrong during submission or notification delivery, the team can diagnose and resolve it faster.
