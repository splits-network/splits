Today's release makes it easier to create roles, browse jobs, and manage applications. A new role creation wizard guides you through the process step by step, while job listings and application pages get meaningful usability improvements.

## New Features

### Add Role Wizard

You can now create new roles using a guided multi-step wizard. Instead of filling out a single long form, the wizard walks you through each section: role details, requirements, compensation, and settings. Each step validates your input before moving forward, so you catch issues early rather than after submission.

### Enhanced Job Cards and Table Rows

Job cards now display images and richer metadata, making it easier to distinguish roles at a glance. Table rows have been updated to show additional details inline, and the grid view icon has been refreshed for better visual consistency. Whether you prefer card or table layouts, you see more useful information without clicking through.

## Improvements

### Better Application Notifications

Toast notifications in the application detail and applications list components have been improved. You get clearer confirmation messages when actions succeed and more helpful error messages when something goes wrong. URL handling in application links has also been tightened to prevent broken navigation.

### Updated Job Timestamps

Job listings now display "updated at" timestamps instead of "posted at" dates, giving you a more accurate picture of when a role was last modified. This is especially useful for identifying roles that have been recently refreshed versus those that may be stale.

### Improved Jobs Filters Layout

The jobs filter panel now has a clearer title and better layout, making it easier to scan your active filters and adjust them. Spacing between job list items has also been refined for a cleaner browsing experience.

### Streamlined User Profile Settings

Profile settings have been simplified by removing the separate marketplace settings section. Your profile configuration is now consolidated into a single, cleaner layout.

### Stable List View Performance

The standardized list hook now uses optimized dependency management, eliminating unnecessary re-renders when browsing paginated data. Pages with large lists load faster and scroll more smoothly, especially when switching between pages or updating filters.
