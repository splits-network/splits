This release improves how Splits Network appears in search engines and refines the navigation experience across the platform.

## New Features

### Rich Structured Data for Search Engines

All public-facing pages -- including candidate profiles, corporate listings, and documentation -- now include structured data markup. This means search engines like Google can display richer previews of your job listings and company profiles, helping you attract more candidates and recruiter partners organically.

### RSS and Atom Feeds

You can now subscribe to platform updates via RSS or Atom feeds. Add the feed to your favorite reader to stay informed about new features and changes without logging into the platform.

### Redesigned Header and Navigation

The portal header has been redesigned with a new UserDropdown component that provides faster access to your profile, settings, and sign-out actions. The layout is cleaner and better organized, especially on mobile devices.

### AI and Security Configuration

New AI-related configuration files and security policies are published for the candidate, corporate, and portal sections. These ensure that AI crawlers and integrations interact with your data according to your preferences.

## Improvements

### Role Management Overhaul

The role wizard modal has been renamed and restructured for clarity. Adding and editing roles across your organization is now more intuitive, with consistent behavior whether you access it from the team page, the admin panel, or a company profile.

### Improved Email Handling

User email display logic now handles edge cases more gracefully, showing properly formatted email addresses with sensible fallbacks when data is incomplete.

### Updated Logo and Branding

The header now uses refreshed icon and logo assets for a more polished, professional appearance across all pages.
