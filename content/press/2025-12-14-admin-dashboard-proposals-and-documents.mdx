Today's release is one of the largest yet, delivering an admin dashboard, a complete proposals workflow, document management, and major usability improvements across the platform.

## New Features

### Admin Dashboard

Company administrators now have a dedicated dashboard showing key statistics at a glance: active roles, candidate pipeline counts, placement progress, and team activity. Instead of navigating between multiple pages to piece together your organization's status, everything is summarized in one place.

### Proposals Management

Recruiters can now create, submit, and track proposals directly within the platform. Company admins can review incoming proposals from their recruiter network, and recruiters can view the status of every proposal they've submitted. This replaces the back-and-forth of email-based proposal discussions with a structured, trackable workflow.

### Document Service

You can now upload, retrieve, and manage documents within the platform. Attach resumes, offer letters, contracts, and other files directly to candidates, placements, or roles. Documents are stored securely and accessible to authorized team members at any time.

### Candidate Ownership and Placement Lifecycle

The platform now tracks candidate ownership, making it clear which recruiter sourced each candidate. A full placement lifecycle view shows collaborators involved in each placement from sourcing through close, ensuring proper credit and transparent fee splits.

### Role Management

Administrators can now create, edit, and manage roles with full access control. Role permissions determine what each team member can view and modify, giving you precise control over your organization's workflow.

## Improvements

### Grid and Table View Toggle

You can now switch between grid and table views on the candidates and placements pages. Grid view offers a visual, card-based layout ideal for quick scanning, while table view provides dense, sortable rows for detailed comparison. A search bar on both pages helps you find specific records fast.

### View Mode Toggle for Recruiters and Roles

The same grid-versus-table flexibility is now available on the recruiters and roles lists. Choose the layout that matches how you prefer to work, and the platform remembers your preference.

### Responsive Role Layouts

The roles list now adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, ensuring a clean layout whether you're on a widescreen monitor or a laptop.

### API Documentation

All services now include interactive API documentation, making it easier for integration partners to explore available endpoints and understand request and response formats.
