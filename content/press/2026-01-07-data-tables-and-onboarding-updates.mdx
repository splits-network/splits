Today's release delivers a more polished browsing experience with new table components, improved navigation, and better data handling throughout the platform.

## New Features

### Data Tables with Expandable Rows

A new data table component is now available across the platform, featuring expandable rows that reveal additional details inline. Click a row to see more without navigating to a separate page. The tables are keyboard accessible, so you can navigate and expand rows using arrow keys and Enter.

### Candidate Pipeline Tab

The role detail page now includes a dedicated Candidate Pipeline tab. When viewing a specific role, you can switch to the pipeline tab to see every candidate at each stage of the hiring process. No more jumping between pages to understand where candidates stand for a given role.

### Onboarding with Role-Specific Data

The onboarding completion step now collects and submits role-specific information. Whether you're setting up as a recruiter or a hiring company, the platform captures the right details for your role type during onboarding, reducing follow-up configuration later.

## Improvements

### Improved Pagination and Search

Pagination controls have been redesigned for better usability. Page navigation is clearer, and the search input has been refined so you can find what you're looking for faster. These improvements apply across all list views in the platform.

### Unified Contact Resolution

Contact information lookups have been streamlined into a single, unified resolver. When the platform needs to find a recruiter's or candidate's contact details, it now uses one consistent path instead of multiple approaches. This means fewer missed contacts and more reliable notifications.

### Updated Navigation Links

Links throughout the header, footer, sidebar, and job listings have been updated for consistency. Navigation paths are uniform across the platform, so bookmarks and shared links work reliably regardless of where they originated.

### Notification Bell Visibility

The notification bell icon has been updated with improved color contrast, making it easier to spot at a glance whether you have pending notifications.

### Enhanced Chart Styling

Dashboard charts now render with refined styling options, improving readability of data visualizations on your dashboard.
