Today's release brings a significantly improved AI review experience and visual polish across the platform. Whether you're evaluating candidate fit or managing your company dashboard, things are cleaner and faster.

## New Features

### Redesigned AI Review Panel

The AI review panel now presents a much richer view of candidate evaluations. Strengths, concerns, and skills are displayed with clear visual indicators, making it easier to scan a candidate's profile at a glance. Matched skills are highlighted distinctly from missing skills, so you can immediately see where a candidate excels and where gaps exist.

We've also streamlined how the review panel loads data. Reviews now fetch using a dedicated identifier, which means faster load times and more reliable results when you're working through a stack of applications.

### Gate Review Infrastructure

You can now set up structured review gates for your hiring pipeline. Gate reviews let you define checkpoints where applications must be evaluated before advancing to the next stage. This gives hiring teams more control over quality and consistency in their screening process.

### Improved Application Management

A new actions component within the AI review flow lets you take immediate action on applications without leaving the review screen. Approve, reject, or advance candidates directly from the review panel.

## Improvements

### Cleaner Company Dashboard

The company dashboard has been simplified by removing decorative visual elements that added clutter without adding value. The result is a more focused workspace that puts your data front and center.

### Consistent Icon Loading

Font Awesome icons now load consistently across all applications. Previously, icons could flash or load inconsistently on certain pages. This update ensures a smooth, polished experience everywhere.
