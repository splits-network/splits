Today marks the launch of the candidate-facing portal, giving recruiters a dedicated space to send candidates and giving candidates real tools to manage their job search.

## New Features

### Candidate Portal and Authentication

Candidates now have their own portal at applicant.network with full sign-in and sign-up flows, including email verification and OAuth options. Signed-in candidates are automatically redirected to their dashboard, and the experience is streamlined so candidates can get started without friction.

### Recruiter-Candidate Invitation System

Recruiters can now invite candidates to join the platform, and candidates can accept or decline those invitations with a single click. Each invitation tracks consent, so there is a clear record of the recruiter-candidate relationship. Recruiters can also resend or cancel pending invitations, giving you full control over your candidate pipeline.

### Candidate Dashboard with Live Data

The candidate dashboard now shows real statistics and recent applications pulled directly from the platform, replacing placeholder content with actual pipeline data. Candidates see their active applications, submission history, and recruiter connections at a glance.

### Public Job Search

Candidates can now browse and search open positions on the public job board with server-side filtering and pagination. Search terms sync with the URL, so candidates can bookmark or share specific searches. Job detail pages display full role information so candidates can evaluate opportunities before applying.

### GDPR and CCPA Consent Management

You can now manage cookie and data-processing consent directly within the platform. Consent preferences are tracked with timestamps, and dedicated routes let users update their choices at any time. This keeps your organization compliant with GDPR and CCPA requirements out of the box.

### Document Management Enhancements

Candidates and recruiters can now upload, delete, and retrieve documents through the platform. Attach resumes, cover letters, and supporting files directly to candidate profiles for easy access during the hiring process.

## Improvements

### Responsive Page Layouts

Profile, cookie policy, privacy policy, terms of service, job detail, integrations, about, and status pages now use full-width layouts that adapt to any screen size. No more cramped content on larger monitors.

### Enhanced User Navigation

The navigation bar now features an improved user dropdown with richer profile management options, replacing the previous minimal user button. You can access your profile, settings, and account actions more quickly.

### Standardized API Responses

All API responses now follow a consistent format, making integrations more predictable and reducing the chance of errors when working with platform data.

### Email Domain Updates

All platform emails now come from updates.splits.network, providing a unified and professional sender identity across every notification.
