Today's release introduces AI-powered application screening, a complete billing and subscription system, in-app notifications, and marketplace tools for recruiters.

## New Features

### AI-Assisted Application Screening

The platform now uses AI to review incoming applications and highlight the strongest candidates for each role. When applications arrive, the screening engine evaluates candidate qualifications against job requirements and surfaces a fit assessment. You can trigger an AI review on any application or let the system run automatically. This helps you spend less time reading through unsuitable applications and more time engaging with top candidates.

### Billing and Subscription Management

You can now manage your subscription directly within the platform. The new billing page shows your current plan, usage details, and payment history. Upgrade, downgrade, or update payment methods without leaving the portal. Access controls ensure that only authorized team members can modify billing settings.

### In-App Notifications

Important updates now appear directly inside the platform. Instead of relying solely on email, you will see real-time notifications for events like new applications, stage changes, and proposal updates as they happen. This keeps you informed without having to check your inbox.

### Marketplace Settings for Recruiters

Recruiters can now configure their marketplace presence through dedicated settings. Set your specializations, preferred industries, geographic focus, and availability. Hiring companies browsing the marketplace can see these details, helping them find the right recruiter for their roles. Connection features let recruiters and companies establish working relationships directly through the platform.

### User Profile Management

You can now update your profile information and change your password directly from the settings page. The profile page adapts based on your role, showing relevant fields and options for recruiters, company administrators, and candidates alike.

## Improvements

### AI Review History

Every AI-generated screening result is stored and accessible, so you can review past assessments, compare candidates, and track how recommendations evolved as new applications came in. Dedicated endpoints let you fetch reviews for any application at any time.

### Enhanced Role-Based Visibility

Stage update controls for applications are now visible only to platform administrators, keeping the interface clean for users who do not need those tools. The applications list has been streamlined to show the right columns and actions based on your permissions.

### Recruiter Submission Notifications

When a recruiter submits a candidate for a role, notifications now include the candidate's user identifier so hiring companies can quickly cross-reference the submission with their records.
