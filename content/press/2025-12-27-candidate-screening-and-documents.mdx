A major step forward for the screening workflow: recruiters now have everything they need in a single view, and candidates can track their own applications more easily.

## New Features

### Candidate Screening Hub

You can now screen candidates without jumping between tabs. The new screening view brings together the proposal, job details, candidate profile, and all uploaded documents into one cohesive interface. Modals let you drill into specific details for the job, the candidate, or their documents without losing your place.

### Proposal Review with Documents

When reviewing proposals, you now see all attached application documents inline. Resumes, cover letters, and supporting files load directly in the proposal screen, so you can evaluate candidates with the full picture right in front of you.

### Candidate Application History

Candidates can now view their complete application history with enriched job data. Each application shows the associated job details, current status, and timeline, making it easy to track where things stand across multiple opportunities.

## Improvements

### Consistent User Identification

User identification is now standardized across all services. Whether you are interacting with jobs, applications, or documents, the platform resolves your identity the same way every time. This eliminates edge cases where certain actions could fail due to mismatched identifiers.

### Improved Document Handling

Document retrieval now follows a consistent format across the entire platform. Resumes, attachments, and supporting files load more reliably and display with predictable structure regardless of where you access them.

### Updated Profile and Settings Layout

The user profile and settings pages now have a cleaner layout, making it easier to find and update your information.
