Today's release delivers a suite of tools that streamline how recruiters discover opportunities, manage candidates, and submit them for roles.

## New Features

### Candidate Submission Workflow

You can now submit candidates to roles directly from your existing candidate pool. A new submission modal lets you search through candidates you've already added to the platform, select the right match, and submit them in seconds. No more re-entering candidate information for each new opportunity.

### Candidate Verification

A new verification system lets you track and update the verification status of candidate profiles. Verified candidates carry a visible status indicator, giving hiring companies confidence that the recruiter has confirmed the candidate's credentials, availability, and interest. This builds trust across the marketplace and helps verified submissions stand out.

### Recruiter-Candidate Relationships

The platform now formally tracks the relationship between recruiters and their candidates. When you add a candidate or submit them for a role, that relationship is recorded and visible to relevant parties. This ensures proper attribution, prevents duplicate outreach, and makes it clear who sourced each candidate throughout the placement lifecycle.

### Browse All Active Roles

Recruiters can now browse all active roles across the marketplace, not just roles from companies they're directly connected to. This opens up more placement opportunities and makes it easier to discover roles that match your candidate pool.

## Improvements

### Salary Ranges on Role Cards

Role cards now display minimum and maximum salary information directly in the list view. You can quickly scan compensation ranges while browsing roles, helping you prioritize which opportunities to pursue based on your candidates' expectations.

### Enhanced Candidate Management

Candidate profiles and list views have been refined with improved data handling and a smoother editing experience, making day-to-day candidate management faster and more reliable.
