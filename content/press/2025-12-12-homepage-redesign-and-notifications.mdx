Today's release transforms the Splits Network homepage and introduces automated email notifications, two updates that make the platform more inviting for new users and more useful for active teams.

## New Features

### Redesigned Homepage

You can now explore Splits Network through a fully redesigned landing page. The new homepage features a modern hero section that immediately communicates what the platform does, a responsive navigation bar that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile, and dedicated sections highlighting the platform's key capabilities. Updated statistics give visitors a real-time snapshot of marketplace activity, and refreshed branding throughout the header and footer delivers a more polished, professional feel.

### Email Notifications

You no longer need to manually check for updates. The platform now sends automated email notifications when key events happen, such as candidate submissions, application status changes, and placement milestones. Whether you're a recruiter waiting on feedback or a hiring manager reviewing candidates, you'll be notified the moment something needs your attention.

## What's Next

With the homepage and notification system in place, upcoming releases will expand the platform's collaboration tools and add new public-facing pages for pricing, careers, and partner information.
