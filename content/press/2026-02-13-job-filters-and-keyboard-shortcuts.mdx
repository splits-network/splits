Today's release makes finding and navigating to the right information significantly faster, with new job filters, platform-wide keyboard shortcuts, and a cleaner admin architecture.

## New Features

### Commute Type and Job Level Filters

Job listings now support commute type (remote, hybrid, on-site) and job level (entry, mid, senior, executive) as filterable fields. When browsing or searching jobs, you can narrow results by these criteria to quickly find roles that match your candidates' preferences or your hiring needs. These fields are validated during job creation, so every listing has consistent, reliable data.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

You can now navigate the platform using keyboard shortcuts. Press a key combination to jump to candidates, jobs, messages, or any major section without reaching for the mouse. A shortcuts modal (accessible from the help menu) shows all available shortcuts at a glance. When searching, pressing Enter now selects the top result instantly, and a keyboard hint badge shows you this shortcut right in the search bar.

### Platform Admin Restructure

The platform administrator role has been restructured with a dedicated migration path. Platform admins now operate through the standard roles system with proper access controls, replacing the previous special-case handling. This means cleaner audit trails and more consistent permission checks across every feature.

## Improvements

### Improved Search Bar and Navigation

The search bar positioning and alignment have been refined for a cleaner header layout. Deep links from search results now take you directly to the correct detail page, and company access control has been tightened so search results only show records you're authorized to view.

### Better Header Layout

The portal header has been adjusted for improved structure and spacing, with the search bar fitting more naturally into the overall navigation flow.
