Today's release makes the application pipeline smarter and more transparent. Applications now route themselves based on context, a redesigned detail page gives you richer information, and email notifications ensure no gate event goes unnoticed.

## New Features

### Intelligent Stage Routing

When a candidate submits an application, the platform now automatically determines the correct next stage based on whether a recruiter is involved. Recruiter-submitted candidates follow the full review pipeline, while direct applicants are routed appropriately. This eliminates manual stage assignment and keeps your pipeline moving without extra clicks.

### Gate History and Actions

New components on the application detail page give you a complete timeline of gate reviews, including who reviewed, what decision was made, and when. Proposal actions let you approve, reject, or request more information directly from the gate history view.

### Provide Info Modal

When a gate review requires additional information from the candidate or recruiter, you can now send a structured request through a dedicated modal. This keeps the feedback loop tight and ensures nothing gets lost in email threads.

### Gate Event Email Notifications

Every gate event, whether an approval, rejection, or information request, now triggers an email notification to the relevant parties. Recruiters know immediately when their candidate advances or needs attention, and hiring managers stay informed without checking the dashboard constantly.

## Improvements

### Redesigned Application Detail Page

The application detail page has been rebuilt with new components for a clearer, more organized layout. Related information is grouped logically, and key actions are more accessible. You spend less time hunting for information and more time making decisions.

### Simplified Candidate Creation

The candidate creation flow has been streamlined to focus on what matters: getting the candidate into the system quickly. Unnecessary complexity has been removed, resulting in a faster, more reliable submission process.
