Today's release focuses on personalization and polish, with profile image support and several onboarding fixes that make getting started on the platform smoother.

## New Features

### Profile Image Upload

You can now upload, change, and remove your profile photo directly from your user settings. Your image appears across the platform -- in team views, recruiter profiles, and candidate records -- making it easier for collaborators to put a face to a name.

### In-App Support Widget

A HelpNinja support widget is now embedded directly in the platform. If you run into an issue or have a question, you can reach our support team without leaving the page you're working on.

## Improvements

### Smoother Onboarding

The onboarding flow has been refined so that your organization membership is fully created before billing setup begins. This eliminates edge cases where new users could hit errors during their first billing configuration. The completion step is also more responsive on smaller screens, so onboarding works well on tablets and mobile devices.

### Better Logo Scaling

Company logos now scale proportionally in all contexts, preventing stretched or cropped images in headers and profile cards.

### Streamlined Job Type Selection

Selecting job types during onboarding is now simpler, with a cleaner interface that reduces unnecessary steps.
