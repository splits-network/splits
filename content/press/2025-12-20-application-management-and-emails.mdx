Today's release transforms how you manage applications, with bulk actions, powerful search, self-service withdrawal for candidates, and polished email notifications that keep everyone in the loop.

## New Features

### Bulk Application Actions

You can now select multiple applications and perform actions in bulk, such as advancing candidates to the next stage, archiving inactive submissions, or updating statuses across your pipeline. This saves significant time when managing high-volume roles.

### Application Withdrawal

Candidates can now withdraw their own applications directly from the platform. The withdrawal process includes a clear confirmation step and automatically notifies the hiring company and assigned recruiter so everyone stays aligned. A full audit trail records every withdrawal for compliance and reporting.

### Server-Side Application Search and Pagination

The applications list now supports server-side pagination and multi-term search. You can search across candidate names, job titles, and other fields simultaneously, and results load quickly regardless of how many applications are in your pipeline. This replaces the previous client-side approach that slowed down with larger datasets.

### Recruiter Application Management

Recruiters now have a dedicated flow for managing candidate submissions. When a recruiter submits a candidate, the platform automatically tracks stage progression, links the recruiter to the application, and sends notifications at each milestone. The system also identifies which recruiter is actively representing each candidate, preventing duplicate submissions and ensuring proper credit.

### Recruiter Dashboard and Invitations

Recruiters get a new dashboard showing their active candidates, pending invitations, and proposal pipeline. The invitations management page lets you track every candidate invitation you have sent and see responses in real time.

### Professional Email Notifications

Every notification email, from application confirmations to placement updates, now uses a clean, branded template. Emails include relevant details like application and placement identifiers so you can quickly reference them in your records. The withdrawal notification email has been rewritten for clarity, telling recipients exactly what happened and what to expect next.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Application Submission Tracking

When a candidate applies through a recruiter, the platform now tracks the full submission chain: who submitted, which stage the candidate entered at, and when each transition occurred. Notes added to applications are logged in the audit trail, giving you a complete history of every touchpoint.

### Error Tracking Across the Platform

The platform now monitors for errors in real time across all services. When something goes wrong, the engineering team is alerted immediately so issues can be resolved before they affect your workflow. This runs silently in the background and requires no action on your part.

### Improved Email Presentation

Email notifications now use a responsive layout that looks great on desktop and mobile. Logos render correctly across all email clients, and headings are cleaner and easier to scan.
