Today's release introduces AI-driven automation for application screening, new services for candidate sourcing and role assignment, and foundational SEO improvements.

## New Features

### AI Review Loop

Applications now move through an automated AI review loop that evaluates submissions and manages stage transitions. When a candidate applies, the AI reviews the application and either advances it to the next stage or flags it for manual review. Dedicated action routes let you override AI decisions when needed. This reduces the time recruiters and hiring managers spend on initial screening while keeping humans in the loop for final decisions.

### Candidate Role Assignments

A new candidate role assignments service lets you assign candidates to specific roles with structured tracking. Instead of managing candidate-role relationships informally, you now have a dedicated system that tracks which candidates are assigned to which roles, when assignments were made, and their current status.

### Candidate Sourcers

The new candidate sourcers service connects recruiters to candidates through a formal sourcing relationship. Track which recruiter sourced which candidate, manage sourcing pipelines, and attribute placements back to the right source. This is essential for split-fee calculations and ensures every recruiter gets proper credit for their contributions.

## Improvements

### SEO Foundations

Sitemaps and robots.txt files are now served from public routes, making the platform more discoverable by search engines. Additional public routes have been added for static files, improving accessibility for crawlers without affecting authenticated content. These foundational changes help recruiters and companies find Splits Network through organic search.

### Domain Redirects

WWW redirects have been added for splits.network, applicant.network, and employment-networks.com. Whether someone types the www version or the bare domain, they arrive at the right place. An unnecessary redirect for employment-networks.com has been cleaned up to simplify the routing configuration.
