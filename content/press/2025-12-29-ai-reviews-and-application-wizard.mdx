A packed release today: AI-powered reviews enter the pipeline, the application experience gets a ground-up rebuild, and access controls tighten across the platform.

## New Features

### AI-Powered Application Reviews

Applications now receive automated AI reviews as part of the screening process. After submission, the AI evaluates the application and advances qualifying candidates to the screening stage automatically. Both candidates and recruiters receive email notifications with the review results, keeping everyone informed without manual follow-up.

### Redesigned Application Wizard

The application process has been completely rebuilt with a new modular structure. The updated wizard guides candidates through each step with a cleaner layout, better validation, and improved job detail presentation. You see requirements, compensation, and role details clearly before committing to an application.

### Role-Based Access for Proposals and Applications

Proposals and applications are now scoped based on your role. Recruiters see only their own proposals, hiring companies see proposals relevant to their open roles, and candidates see only their own applications. This ensures everyone accesses exactly the data they should, nothing more.

### Enhanced Job Detail Views

Job listings now display richer information including requirements, compensation details, and relative time formatting. Instead of raw dates, you see "Posted 3 days ago" or "Closing in 2 weeks," making it easier to prioritize which roles deserve your attention.

### Persistent View Mode Preference

When you switch between list and grid views on any browse page, the platform now remembers your choice. Come back later and your preferred layout is already set, no need to toggle it every session.

### Theme Synchronization

Your selected theme now persists reliably across page loads and browser sessions. Whether you prefer light or dark mode, the platform applies it consistently from the moment the page renders, eliminating the brief flash of the wrong theme on load.

## Improvements

### Smarter Sign-Up and Invitation Flow

The sign-up experience now adapts based on context. If you arrive from an invitation link, you see messaging specific to that invitation. After completing sign-up, the platform redirects you to the right destination rather than a generic landing page.

### Improved Sign-In Redirects

Signing in now reliably returns you to the page you were trying to reach. Deep links, invitation URLs, and bookmarked pages all work as expected after authentication.

### Refreshed Application Detail Layout

The application detail page has been reorganized with the actions section repositioned for better visibility and notes displayed more prominently. You can see candidate notes and next steps without scrolling past less relevant information.

### Streamlined Job Listings and Filters

The jobs page loads faster with improved state management, and application filters have been refined for quicker narrowing of results. Stats tracking in role lists now surfaces relevant counts inline.
