Today's update makes job listings more informative and ensures you never miss an important event with expanded automatic notifications.

## New Features

### Richer Job Listings

Job listings now carry significantly more detail. When creating or editing a role, you can specify:

- **Recruiter description** -- internal notes visible only to your recruiting partners, covering sourcing strategy, ideal candidate profiles, or context that helps recruiters present the opportunity effectively.
- **Candidate description** -- the public-facing summary candidates see when evaluating the opportunity.
- **Employment type** -- full-time, part-time, contract, or temporary, clearly labeled so there's no ambiguity.
- **Relocation options** -- indicate whether the role supports relocation, helping recruiters filter candidates by geographic flexibility.
- **Fee split details** -- configure how placement fees are divided between parties, with the split percentages visible to all collaborators on the role.

These additions mean less back-and-forth clarifying role details and more time focused on finding the right candidate.

### Expanded Event Notifications

The notification system now automatically responds to a broader range of platform events. You'll receive timely email alerts for:

- New candidate applications
- Placement status changes
- Proposal submissions and updates
- Candidate profile updates
- Collaboration invitations and responses

Each notification type delivers the right context so you can take action immediately, whether that's reviewing a newly submitted candidate or responding to a proposal update.
