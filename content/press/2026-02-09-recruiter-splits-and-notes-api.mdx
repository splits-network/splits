Today's release delivers transparency into recruiter compensation, a complete notes system for applications, and platform-wide health monitoring improvements.

## New Features

### Recruiter Split Visibility on Placements

Every placement record now shows the recruiter's split amount and percentage. When viewing a placement, you can see exactly how the fee is divided -- making financial expectations transparent for both hiring companies and recruiters. Access controls ensure that each party only sees the split details relevant to them.

### Application Notes API

Application notes are now powered by a full create, read, update, and delete API. Your team can add notes at any pipeline stage, edit them later as context evolves, and remove outdated notes. This structured approach replaces ad-hoc communication with a persistent, searchable record attached to every application.

### Recruiter Bio in Invitations

When a company receives a recruiter invitation, the recruiter's bio is now displayed directly in the invitation detail. This gives hiring managers context about the recruiter's background and specialties before accepting or declining the partnership.

### Scrollable Detail Tabs

The detail view and sidebar panels now feature scrollable tabs with arrow navigation buttons. When a record has many detail sections, you can scroll through tabs smoothly without the interface feeling cramped -- especially useful on smaller screens.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Pre-Screen Display

The pre-screen section now shows summary statistics alongside improved question formatting. At a glance, see how many questions a candidate answered, their completion rate, and review individual responses in a cleaner layout.

### Better Company Information

Company detail sections now feature improved layouts with proper website link handling. URLs are displayed as clickable links, and the overall information hierarchy is easier to scan.

### Smarter Role Fee Handling

The role wizard modal now handles fee inputs more robustly, with better validation and clearer formatting for percentage and flat-rate splits.

### Candidate Detail Enhancements

Candidate detail pages now display the recruiter's bio in the sidebar alongside an improved actions toolbar, giving you richer context about who submitted the candidate and faster access to common actions.

### Standardized Health Checks

All platform services now use a consistent health monitoring pattern with built-in dependency checking. This means faster detection and resolution of any service issues, keeping the platform reliable as it scales.
