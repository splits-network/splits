Today's release introduces the feature our users have been asking for: built-in messaging. You can now communicate directly with recruiters, hiring managers, and other platform participants without switching to email or external chat tools.

## New Features

### Real-Time Messaging

Send and receive messages in real time. Conversations update instantly as new messages arrive, so you can have fluid back-and-forth discussions about candidates, roles, and placements. No more waiting for page refreshes or checking for new messages manually.

### Conversations and Threads

Messages are organized into conversations that you can access from the Messages section. Each conversation tracks the full history between participants, making it easy to revisit past discussions about a specific candidate or role.

### Message Moderation

The chat system includes built-in moderation to maintain a professional environment. Messages are monitored for content that violates platform guidelines, ensuring that all communication stays productive and appropriate.

### Chat Notifications

You'll receive notifications when new messages arrive, even if you're working in another section of the platform. This ensures time-sensitive communications about candidate availability, interview scheduling, or offer discussions are never missed.

### Message Retention Policies

The platform manages message, attachment, and audit retention automatically. Your conversation history is preserved according to defined retention policies, so important discussions are available when you need them while keeping storage manageable.

## Improvements

### Invitation-Based Onboarding Skip

If you're joining the platform through an invitation link, the onboarding wizard now detects this and lets you skip directly to your workspace. Your account is configured based on the invitation context, so you can start working immediately.

### Dynamic Service URLs

Email notifications now link directly to the correct platform URLs based on your environment. Whether you're on the main platform or a staging environment, links in notification emails take you to the right place.
