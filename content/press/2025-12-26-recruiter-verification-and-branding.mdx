Today's update strengthens recruiter verification, sharpens candidate-recruiter visibility, and adds a branding polish to the authentication flow.

## Improvements

### Stronger Recruiter Verification

The platform now verifies recruiter status more thoroughly when accessing dashboards, profiles, and candidate-facing pages. If you are a recruiter, the system confirms your active status before granting access, which means fewer edge cases where permissions slip through the cracks.

### Automatic Recruiter Activation on Onboarding

When recruiters complete onboarding, their status is now set to active automatically. No more waiting for a manual flip. You finish the steps, and you are ready to start working immediately.

### Scoped Candidate Views for Recruiters

Recruiters now see only the candidates relevant to their assignments and relationships. Candidate lists are filtered based on your actual scope, so you spend less time sifting through irrelevant profiles and more time focusing on the candidates you are working with.

### Improved Proposal Filtering and Pagination

Browsing proposals is now faster and more responsive. Filtering logic has been tightened up and pagination handles larger result sets more efficiently, so you can move through proposals without lag.

### Branded Sign-In and Sign-Up Pages

The Splits Network logo now appears on the sign-in and sign-up screens, giving the authentication flow a more polished and professional feel from the very first interaction.

### Invitation Stats at a Glance

The invitations page now displays summary stats with clearer descriptions and visual distinction, making it easier to see how many invitations are pending, accepted, or expired without reading every line.
