Today's update introduces role-based permissions across the platform, a frequently requested dark mode toggle, and several new public-facing pages. Together, these changes make Splits Network more secure, more comfortable to use, and easier to evaluate for prospective customers.

## New Features

### Role-Based Access Control

You now have granular control over who sees what. The platform enforces role-based permissions tied to your organization membership, so recruiters, company admins, and team members each see exactly the information and actions relevant to their role. This means sensitive placement details and financial data stay visible only to the people who need them.

### Dark Mode

You can now switch between light and dark themes directly from the header. Whether you prefer a bright workspace or a darker interface for late-night recruiting sessions, the toggle is always one click away.

### Richer Job Listings

Job listings now display company information directly alongside role details. When you're browsing opportunities or evaluating placements, you'll see the hiring company's name and context without needing to navigate away.

### Pricing, Careers, and Partner Pages

New public pages make it easier for prospective users to evaluate the platform. The Pricing page breaks down plan tiers and features, the Careers page outlines opportunities to join the Splits Network team, and the Partners page describes how recruiting agencies and technology providers can integrate with the marketplace. An Updates page also provides a public roadmap so you can see what's coming next.

### User Profile Dropdown

A new user dropdown in the header gives you quick access to your profile, account settings, and sign-out, all without leaving your current workflow.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Notification Delivery

The notification system now supports richer inter-service communication, ensuring that email alerts are triggered reliably across all platform events. A new test workflow lets us verify notification delivery end to end.

### Service Health Monitoring

All backend services now expose health check endpoints, giving the operations team real-time visibility into platform availability. This translates to faster detection and resolution of any issues that could affect your experience.
