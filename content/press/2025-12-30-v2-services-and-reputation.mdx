Today marks a significant infrastructure milestone: core services move to V2 with role-aware routing, and a new reputation system gives hiring companies more confidence when selecting recruiters.

## New Features

### Recruiter Reputation System

You can now view and manage recruiter reputation scores on the platform. The reputation system tracks recruiter performance metrics, giving hiring companies a data-driven way to evaluate potential recruiting partners. Scores are built over time based on placement outcomes, responsiveness, and reliability, helping you identify top-performing recruiters faster.

### V2 API Routes with Role-Based Access

The platform's core services, including jobs, candidates, applications, network, and billing, now operate through upgraded V2 routes. These routes enforce role-based access at the gateway level, meaning the system verifies your permissions before your request even reaches the underlying service. The result is faster responses and more consistent behavior across every feature.

## Improvements

### Cleaner, Lighter UI

Shadow effects throughout the platform have been dialed back for a cleaner, more modern appearance. Cards, panels, and containers now feel lighter and less visually heavy, making content easier to scan.

### Improved Invitation Grid Layout

The invitations page grid now adapts better to different screen sizes. Whether you are on a laptop or a wide monitor, the layout uses available space efficiently without awkward gaps or cramped cards.

### Better Async Page Loading

Pages that depend on URL parameters now handle loading more gracefully. Search results and filtered views render faster, particularly on slower connections, because the platform processes parameters more efficiently.
