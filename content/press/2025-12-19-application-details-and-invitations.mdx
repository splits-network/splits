Today's release expands the candidate experience with richer application views, recruiter relationship management, and a brand-new corporate marketing site.

## New Features

### Application Detail Pages

Candidates can now click into any application to see the full picture: job details, current application status, timeline, and next steps. Instead of scanning a list and wondering where things stand, you get a dedicated page with everything in one place.

### My Recruiters Section

Candidates now have a "My Recruiters" section in their profile showing every recruiter they are connected with. This makes it easy to see who is representing you, review your active relationships, and stay in the loop on which recruiters are working on your behalf.

### Invitation Management System

The invitation workflow is now fully operational end to end. Recruiters can send invitations, and the system handles acceptance, revocation, and status tracking automatically. Both sides see clear, up-to-date information about where each invitation stands.

### Corporate Marketing Site

The new corporate site launches today, built for speed and visual impact. It serves as the public-facing home for Splits Network, showcasing the platform's value proposition, features, and resources for recruiters and hiring companies.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Sign-In Redirect

When candidates or recruiters sign in, the platform now remembers where they were headed and redirects them to the right page after authentication. No more landing on a generic dashboard when you clicked a specific link.

### Refreshed Branding and Metadata

All three applications, the portal, the candidate site, and the corporate site, now share updated logos, favicons, and metadata. Social sharing previews display polished images and descriptions, and the platform supports progressive web app installation with proper icons and manifests.
