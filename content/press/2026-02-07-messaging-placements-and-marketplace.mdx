This is one of our biggest releases yet, introducing a complete messaging experience, redesigned placement management, and a recruiter marketplace -- three major features that transform how you collaborate on the platform.

## New Features

### Messaging with Filters and Thread Panels

The messaging system now includes header filters, conversation stats, and a dedicated thread panel. You can filter conversations by status, participant, or date, then dive into a thread panel that keeps the full context visible alongside your inbox. Conversations are also linked to candidates, so recruiters always know which candidate a thread relates to.

### Notification Categories and Counts

Your notification center now groups alerts by category with badge counts, so you can quickly see how many new messages, application updates, or system alerts need your attention. The notification UI has been refreshed for a cleaner, more scannable layout.

### Placement Management Suite

Placements now have a dedicated detail view, sidebar panel, filter bar, and stats summary. You can filter placements by status, company, or date range, view key metrics at the top of the page, and drill into any placement for the full picture. This makes tracking your placement pipeline as easy as managing your candidate pipeline.

### Recruiter Marketplace

A new recruiter marketplace lets hiring companies discover, evaluate, and connect with recruiting partners. Browse recruiter profiles, filter by specialty or location, and view context about each recruiter's track record before sending an invitation to collaborate.

### Invitation Management

Managing recruiter invitations just got a major upgrade. A grid view shows all pending and active invitations with an actions toolbar for quick decisions. A detail sidebar lets you review the full invitation without leaving the list, and stats at the top give you a snapshot of your invitation pipeline.

### Candidate Table View

Candidates can now be viewed in a table format with expandable rows. Click any row to expand it and see sidebar details without navigating away from your list. This is ideal for high-volume reviewers who need to scan many candidates quickly.

### Company Management Components

Companies now have dedicated header filters, a detail sidebar, stats overview, and a table view -- bringing the same powerful management interface to company records that you already have for candidates and jobs.

### Roles Grid and Table Views

Role management now offers both grid and table views with enhanced action buttons and modal workflows. Whether you prefer cards or rows, you can manage your team's roles in the layout that works best for you.

## Improvements

### Improved Job Detail Formatting

The job overview tab has been reformatted for better readability, with cleaner section breaks and more consistent spacing. Key details are easier to scan at a glance.

### Streamlined Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar has been cleaned up by removing deprecated navigation items, keeping the menu focused on the features you actually use.
