Today's release focuses on security and reliability improvements that make the platform more robust for everyone.

## Improvements

### Stronger Security Protections

We've added multiple layers of cross-site scripting (XSS) protection to all structured data rendered on public pages. Special characters, Unicode sequences, and edge-case payloads are now escaped before they reach the browser. This is a proactive hardening measure -- your data was already safe, and now it's even more secure.

### Improved Service Health Monitoring

The service health check system now handles unexpected responses more gracefully, preventing false alerts when a service returns non-standard data. The status banner on the portal also uses improved HTML semantics for better accessibility.

### Smoother Invitation Acceptance

The flow for accepting invitations to join a company or recruiting team has been refined with an updated AI-powered review step. When you receive an invitation, the acceptance process is now clearer and faster.

### Sidebar Navigation Updates

Role labels in the sidebar navigation have been updated to better reflect current platform terminology, making it easier to find the sections relevant to your role.
