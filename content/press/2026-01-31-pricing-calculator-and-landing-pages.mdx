Today's release is our biggest yet for the public-facing platform. A brand-new pricing calculator, redesigned landing pages, and a rich text editor bring Splits Network to a new level of polish and usability.

## New Features

### Interactive Pricing Calculator

You can now explore exactly how much you'll earn on every placement with our new Return-on-Time-Invested (RTI) calculator. Select a role type, enter the fee amount, and see an animated payout breakdown that shows your take-home earnings in real time. The calculator includes tier comparisons so you can see how upgrading your plan increases your payout, with clear highlighting of the differences between tiers.

The calculator is available directly on the pricing page, making it easy for prospective recruiters to model their earnings before signing up.

### Redesigned Landing Pages

The public website has been completely refreshed with new sections designed specifically for recruiters and hiring companies:

- **Hero section** -- a compelling introduction to the platform with clear calls to action
- **Problem and solution sections** -- articulating the challenges of traditional recruiting and how Splits Network addresses them
- **Metrics section** -- showcasing platform performance and outcomes
- **Recruiter-focused section** -- highlighting the benefits and tools available to recruiting professionals

Each section features smooth animations that bring the content to life as you scroll, creating a modern, engaging experience.

### Rich Markdown Editor

A full-featured Markdown editor is now available throughout the platform. When writing job descriptions, candidate notes, or any long-form content, you get a rich editing experience with formatting toolbar, live preview, and intuitive controls. This replaces plain text areas with a professional writing tool that produces clean, well-formatted content.

### Discount Management

Companies and recruiters can now apply and manage discounts on their subscriptions. The platform supports various discount types that can be applied during checkout or by account administrators. This gives sales teams flexibility in structuring deals and provides transparency to users about any active promotions on their account.

### Company Billing Profiles and Stripe Connect

Companies now have dedicated billing profiles that connect directly to Stripe. This integration supports payout routing, payment collection, and financial record-keeping within the platform. Combined with the placement snapshot feature launched earlier this month, the billing system now covers the full lifecycle from placement to payout.

### Application Timeline Chart

A new timeline chart on the dashboard visualizes your application activity over time. See submission volume, advancement rates, and placement trends at a glance. This gives both recruiters and companies a data-driven view of their hiring pipeline performance.

### Enhanced Invitation Acceptance

When candidates accept an invitation, the platform now handles the full onboarding flow automatically, creating user accounts and setting up memberships in one seamless step. This dramatically reduces the friction between receiving an invitation and being productive on the platform.

## Improvements

### Improved Authentication Flows

Sign-in and SSO callback error handling has been strengthened with better user feedback. If authentication encounters an issue, you'll see clear, actionable messages rather than technical errors. Logging has also been enhanced to help resolve authentication issues faster.

### Cleaner Subscription Management

The discount and subscription management code has been streamlined for better reliability. Plan changes, upgrades, and discount applications are handled more consistently, reducing the chance of billing discrepancies.
