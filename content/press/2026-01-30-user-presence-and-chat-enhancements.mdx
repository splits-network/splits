Today's release builds on yesterday's chat launch with presence awareness and significant usability improvements. Know who's available, scroll through message history, and navigate conversations more fluidly.

## New Features

### User Presence

You can now see who's currently online across the platform. Presence indicators appear in messaging and application views, showing you which recruiters, hiring managers, and candidates are active right now. This helps you decide whether to send a message and expect a quick reply, or leave a note for someone to pick up later.

### Message History

Conversations now support loading older messages as you scroll up. Your full conversation history is accessible within the thread, so you can reference earlier discussions without searching through email or notes. The system loads messages in batches for a smooth scrolling experience.

### Scroll-to-Bottom Navigation

A new button appears in chat threads when you've scrolled up through history, letting you jump back to the latest messages with a single click. This is especially useful in active conversations where new messages arrive while you're reviewing earlier context.

## Improvements

### Improved Chat Navigation

Conversations now use streamlined URL routing, making it easier to share links to specific conversations and navigate directly to a thread from notifications. The messaging interface loads faster and handles conversation switching more smoothly.

### Enhanced Message Display

The chat thread panel has been refined with better scrolling behavior and message formatting. Messages display more cleanly, timestamps are easier to read, and the overall feel of the messaging experience is more polished.

### Smarter Message Fetching

The chat system now fetches messages with additional context, improving how threads load and display. Conversations open faster and show the right messages immediately, even for threads with extensive history.
