This is a significant release for recruiters, introducing company management tools and a wave of new UI components that make day-to-day work faster and more visual.

## New Features

### Recruiter Company Management

Recruiters can now view and manage the companies they work with directly from the platform. See detailed company information, track your partnerships, and manage invitations -- all from a single, dedicated interface. The system also checks which companies you're authorized to manage, ensuring you only see what's relevant to you.

### Placement Cards and Detail Sidebar

A new placement card component gives you a visual snapshot of each placement: candidate name, company, status, and key dates at a glance. Click any placement to open a detail sidebar with the full picture, including timeline and financial details. A table row view is also available for those who prefer a denser, spreadsheet-style layout.

### Application Timeline

Every application now includes a visual timeline showing the full audit trail -- when it was submitted, reviewed, advanced, or rejected. This gives your team a clear history of every decision made on a candidate without digging through notes or asking colleagues.

### Candidate Editing and Verification

A new modal lets you edit candidate details inline without navigating away from your current view. The verification modal has also been updated, making it faster to confirm candidate credentials.

### Job Submission Wizard

Recruiters can now submit candidates to jobs through a guided wizard that walks you through each step, reducing errors and ensuring all required information is captured upfront.

### Markdown Editor Toggle

The message composer in the thread panel now includes a toggle to switch between plain text and markdown editing. Format your messages with headers, lists, and bold text when you need richer communication.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Recruiter Profiles

Recruiter profiles now display profile images and updated marketplace filter options. When browsing the recruiter marketplace, you can filter by more criteria to find the right partner faster.

### Company Invitations

The company invitations system has been expanded with new components for viewing and managing incoming partnership requests from recruiters.

### Standardized Loading States

Every section of the platform now uses consistent loading indicators. Whether you're waiting for a candidate list, a placement detail, or a job submission form, you'll see smooth, predictable loading animations instead of blank screens.

### Expanded Navigation Access

The sidebar navigation now reflects additional roles, giving more team members direct access to the sections they need.
