Today's release makes profiles richer and authentication more flexible. Showcase your professional presence with linked profiles, and organizations can now manage multiple brands under one roof.

## New Features

### Online Presence Section

Your profile now includes a dedicated online presence section where you can add your LinkedIn, GitHub, and portfolio URLs. For recruiters, this helps companies verify your background and professional network. For candidates, it gives hiring teams quick access to your work samples and professional profiles without asking for links in every conversation.

### Multi-Tenant Authentication

Organizations operating multiple brands or subsidiaries can now authenticate through a unified system. The API gateway recognizes which tenant a user belongs to and routes them accordingly. This means companies with multiple recruiting divisions or brand identities can manage everything from a single platform without juggling separate accounts.

### Terms of Service

A comprehensive Terms of Service page is now available, providing clear guidelines for all platform users. This covers usage terms, responsibilities, and expectations for recruiters, companies, and candidates.

## Improvements

### Better Error Handling for Candidate Creation

When adding a new candidate, the system now provides clearer feedback if something goes wrong. Instead of generic error messages, you'll see specific guidance on what needs to be corrected, whether it's a duplicate entry, missing required field, or validation issue.

### Expanded Platform Access

The platform now supports access from additional staging and partner network domains, making it easier for teams evaluating the platform or operating across multiple environments to connect seamlessly.
