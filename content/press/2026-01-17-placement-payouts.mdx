Today's release introduces the financial backbone for successful placements. When a candidate is placed, the platform now captures a complete snapshot and tracks every payout transaction from start to finish.

## New Features

### Placement Snapshots

Every successful placement now generates a detailed snapshot that records the terms at the time of hire, including fee splits, compensation details, and the parties involved. This creates an immutable record you can reference at any point, even if the underlying job or candidate details change later.

### Payout Transaction Management

You can now view and track payout transactions tied to each placement. The system records when payouts are initiated, their current status, and the amounts distributed to each party. For recruiters, this means full transparency into when and how you'll be paid. For companies, it provides a clear audit trail of every dollar spent on recruiting fees.
