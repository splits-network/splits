This release puts candidates in the driver's seat with self-service application management and a more polished authentication experience.

## New Features

### Self-Service Application Submission and Withdrawal

Candidates can now submit applications and withdraw from positions entirely on their own. Previously, these actions required recruiter involvement. Now you can browse open roles, apply directly, and change your mind without waiting on anyone else. The entire lifecycle, from submission to withdrawal, is in your hands.

## Improvements

### Smoother Sign-Out Experience

Signing out of the platform now handles redirection cleanly, returning you to the right page without stale session artifacts. The flow is faster and more reliable across all user types.

### Streamlined Candidate Routes

We simplified how the candidate portal handles navigation and data loading behind the scenes. Pages load faster and the experience feels snappier as a result.
