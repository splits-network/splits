Today's release brings AI-powered candidate evaluation directly into your workflow, along with significant improvements to document management and application tools.

## New Features

### AI Review Panel

You can now access AI-generated candidate-job fit analysis directly from the application detail page. The new review panel displays a structured assessment of how well a candidate matches a job's requirements, highlighting strengths, gaps, and key considerations. This helps you make faster, more informed decisions without leaving the application view.

### Document Viewer Modal

Resumes, cover letters, and other candidate documents now open in a dedicated viewer modal. Review documents in full context alongside the application details instead of downloading files or switching browser tabs.

### Job Filters and Stats

The jobs section now includes a filter bar and stats summary, matching the same powerful interface available for candidates and placements. Filter by status, company, or date range, and see key metrics at the top of the page.

### Pre-Screen Request from Applications

You can now send pre-screen requests directly from the application actions toolbar. When reviewing an application, trigger a pre-screen questionnaire with one click -- no need to navigate to the candidate's profile first.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Recruiter Details

Recruiter profile cards now display richer detail, including reputation scores and track record indicators. When evaluating a recruiter partner, you get more context at a glance.

### Improved Search Accuracy

Placement search has been upgraded with better vector-based triggers that automatically update when candidate, company, or job data changes. Search results are now more accurate and up to date.

### Streamlined Application Grid

Application grid items have been redesigned with cleaner layouts and more consistent action buttons. The actions toolbar is more intuitive, with the most common actions front and center.
