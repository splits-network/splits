Today's release puts recruiters front and center with a dedicated dashboard, introduces AI-powered matching, and adds team management tools for growing agencies.

## New Features

### Recruiter Dashboard

Recruiters now have their own dashboard showing active placements, recent activity, and performance stats at a glance. Quick action buttons let you jump directly to common tasks like submitting candidates, reviewing proposals, or checking placement status, all without navigating through menus.

### AI-Assisted Candidate Matching

The platform now uses AI to analyze how well candidates match open roles. When you're evaluating where to place a candidate, the matching engine considers skills, experience, and role requirements to surface the strongest fits. This helps you focus your time on the opportunities most likely to result in successful placements.

### Fraud Detection

A new fraud detection layer automatically flags suspicious activity across the platform. Whether it's duplicate candidate submissions, unusual account behavior, or other anomalies, the system alerts administrators so issues can be addressed before they affect your placements.

### Team and Agency Management

Company administrators can now manage team members and agency relationships through dedicated API endpoints. Add team members, assign roles, and organize your agency structure directly within the platform.

### Enhanced Role Creation

The new role creation page now includes company selection for organizations managing multiple entities, plus onboarding automation options that streamline the process of setting up a new position and notifying your recruiter network.

## Improvements

### Company-Specific Job Visibility

Role-based permissions now enforce company-specific job visibility. Recruiters and team members see only the roles relevant to their organization, while platform admins retain full visibility. This ensures confidential roles stay private to the right audience.

### Platform Admin Access to Proposals

Platform administrators can now view all proposals across the marketplace, making it easier to monitor marketplace health, resolve disputes, and support both recruiters and hiring companies.
