The final release of 2025 delivers AI-powered application reviews, visual indicators for trending jobs, and a broad expansion of V2 capabilities across the platform.

## New Features

### AI-Powered Application Reviews

The AI review service is now live. When applications are submitted, the system automatically evaluates candidate-job fit using AI analysis, considering qualifications, experience alignment, and role requirements. Reviews are generated without manual intervention, giving recruiters an objective starting point for every candidate they evaluate.

### NEW and HOT Role Badges

Job listings now display dynamic badges that help you spot opportunities at a glance. Newly posted roles are tagged with a "NEW" badge, while roles attracting high activity are marked "HOT." These indicators make it easy to prioritize which jobs to review first, whether you want the freshest listings or the most competitive ones.

### Enhanced Candidate Editing Permissions

Candidate profiles now support more granular editing controls. The right people can update the right fields based on their role, whether that is a recruiter updating sourcing notes or a hiring manager adjusting candidate status. The application creation process has also been tightened to validate permissions at each step.

### Improved Invitation Management

You can now resend and cancel invitations directly from the invitations list using streamlined controls. Instead of navigating to a detail page, you can take action inline, saving clicks and keeping your workflow moving.

## Improvements

### Expanded V2 API Coverage

V2 routes now cover automation, billing, documents, identity, network, notifications, and role management. This means faster, more consistent behavior across the entire platform, with role-based access enforced uniformly from the gateway.

### Enriched Role and Job Detail Pages

Role headers and list components now display richer information with an improved layout. Job detail pages load data more efficiently and present recruiter and candidate statistics inline, so you see the full context for any role without additional clicks.

### Centralized Utility Functions

Badges, icons, date formatting, currency display, and color styles are now handled by a shared set of utilities. This means visual elements look and behave consistently whether you are browsing jobs, reviewing proposals, or managing candidates.

### Cleaner API Responses

Response handling across the platform has been simplified, eliminating redundant data wrapping that occasionally caused display inconsistencies. What you see on screen now maps more directly to the underlying data.

### Improved User Role Management

Role assignments and transitions are now logged more clearly, and the API provides better visibility into role changes. If your permissions are updated, the platform reflects it immediately without requiring a page refresh.
