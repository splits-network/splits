Today's release is about getting you to the right information faster. New filtering options, personalized data endpoints, and proposal analytics help you spend less time searching and more time acting.

## New Features

### Filter Applications by Gate Status

You can now filter your application list by gate status. Whether you want to see only applications awaiting review, those that have been approved, or candidates stuck at a specific checkpoint, the new filter lets you narrow your view instantly. Combined with existing filters, this gives you precise control over which applications you're looking at.

### Personalized Data Endpoints

New "me" endpoints across the platform let you access your own data directly. Instead of searching through lists to find your records, you can now pull up your jobs, applications, proposals, and analytics with a single action. This speeds up every interaction where you're checking your own pipeline or activity.

### Proposal Summary Statistics

The analytics dashboard now includes summary statistics for proposals. See how many proposals are pending, accepted, or declined at a glance. Track your proposal conversion rate over time and identify trends in your recruiting activity.

### Application-Assignment Linking

Applications and candidate role assignments are now directly linked in a one-to-one relationship. This means every application is clearly tied to a specific role assignment, eliminating ambiguity and making it easier to track a candidate's journey from proposal through placement.

## Improvements

### Consistent Navigation

All navigation links across the platform now use consistent URL patterns. Whether you're clicking through proposals, viewing headers, or navigating from a not-found page, links take you where you expect without redirect hops or broken paths.
