Today's release introduces a completely redesigned job creation experience and several features that make working with recruiters and candidates more efficient.

## New Features

### Multi-Step Job Creation Wizard

Creating a job listing is now a guided, multi-step process. The new wizard walks you through each section -- job details, requirements, compensation, and pre-screen questions -- one step at a time. This structure ensures nothing gets missed and makes it easier to create thorough, high-quality listings that attract the right candidates.

### Company Invitations for Recruiters

Companies can now send invitations directly to recruiters they'd like to partner with. The invitation includes your company details, the types of roles you're hiring for, and the fee structure. Recruiters see these invitations in their dashboard and can accept or review them with full context about the partnership.

### Resume Download

You can now download a candidate's primary resume directly from their profile. Whether you need to share it with a hiring manager or review it offline, the download is one click away.

## Improvements

### Improved Onboarding Validation

The invitation-based onboarding flow now includes additional validation checks, catching issues earlier in the process so new users don't hit dead ends. Error messages are clearer, and the system guides you to the right next step if something needs attention.

### Public API Access

Select platform endpoints are now accessible without authentication, enabling public job boards and career page integrations to display your open positions. Protected routes remain fully secured -- this change only opens the specific endpoints designed for public consumption.

### Streamlined API Security

The API route configuration has been simplified and hardened. Protected routes are now defined with more granular detail, making it easier to audit exactly which endpoints require authentication and which are public.
