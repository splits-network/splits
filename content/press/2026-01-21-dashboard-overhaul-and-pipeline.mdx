Today's release is one of our biggest yet. The recruiter dashboard has been rebuilt from the ground up, and the entire application flow has been consolidated into a single, unified pipeline. Less clutter, more clarity.

## New Features

### Redesigned Recruiter Dashboard

The recruiter dashboard now opens with an actionable proposals table showing exactly which candidates need your attention. Each row displays the application stage, so you can prioritize at a glance. Below the proposals, an analytics chart visualizes your recruiting activity over time, helping you spot trends and measure performance.

The entire dashboard layout has been reorganized with updated content cards that put your most important metrics front and center.

### Unified Application Flow

We've consolidated the application pipeline into a single, coherent flow. Previously, candidates could exist in multiple tracking systems depending on how they entered your pipeline. Now, every candidate follows one path from proposal through placement. This means one place to check status, one set of actions to take, and one timeline to review.

### Application Stage Display

Application stages are now visible directly in the proposals widget. You can see where each candidate stands, whether they're in screening, under review, or advancing to the next round, without clicking into individual records.

### Pre-Screen Response Improvements

When reviewing candidate pre-screen responses, you now see the actual question text alongside each answer. This makes it much easier to evaluate responses in context without cross-referencing the original job posting.

### Rejection Handling for Proposals

Proposed candidate assignments can now be explicitly rejected with a status transition. This gives hiring teams a clear way to decline a proposed candidate while keeping a record of the decision, rather than simply ignoring the proposal.

## Improvements

### Streamlined Job Status Transitions

Job status changes no longer require a closed reason in every scenario. When a job is paused or status changes for operational reasons, you can transition it without filling in unnecessary fields.

### Consolidated Application Stages

Application stage handling has been simplified across the platform. The system now uses a unified set of stages with clear transitions, reducing confusion about where a candidate stands in the process.

### Cleaner Codebase

We've removed several legacy components that were superseded by the new unified flow, including the old pending applications view and standalone proposals table. The result is a faster, more maintainable platform.
