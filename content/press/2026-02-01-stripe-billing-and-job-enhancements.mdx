This release strengthens the billing backbone of Splits Network and delivers several improvements to how jobs and candidates are displayed across the platform.

## New Features

### Reliable Stripe Payment Processing

Placement invoicing is now powered by verified Stripe webhooks with cryptographic signature validation. This means every payment event -- invoice created, payment received, payout issued -- is processed reliably and securely. Pending invoice items are automatically included when a placement invoice is generated, so you never miss a line item.

### Guarantee Day Tracking on Jobs and Placements

You can now set and track guarantee days on job listings and placements. When creating or editing a job, specify the guarantee period so that both recruiters and hiring companies have clear expectations about replacement guarantees before a placement is finalized.

### Dynamic Pricing Section

A new dynamic pricing section on the marketing site gives prospective users a clear, interactive view of how Splits Network pricing works. Combined with the new "For Recruiters" and "Transparency" pages, everything a recruiter or hiring company needs to evaluate the platform is now available upfront.

## Improvements

### Better Candidate Display

Candidate cards now render at updated display sizes with improved verification status indicators. At a glance, you can see whether a candidate's profile is verified, pending, or incomplete -- helping you prioritize your pipeline faster.

### Updates Feed

A new updates content section keeps you informed about the latest platform changes directly within the product, so you never miss an important release.

### Enhanced Security

We've added HelpNinja verification for secure support access, ensuring that only authenticated users can interact with the support system.
