Splits Network is officially live. The platform brings a purpose-built marketplace to the split-fee recruiting industry, replacing scattered spreadsheets and email chains with a centralized system for recruiters and companies to collaborate on placements.

## What's Included

The initial release delivers the core tools recruiters and hiring teams need to work together effectively:

- **Full ATS** with roles, candidates, and application stage management
- **Split placement tracking** with configurable fee percentages
- **Recruiter network management** for building and maintaining partnerships
- **Three-tier subscription model** offering flexibility for teams of any size
- **Email notifications** keeping all parties informed on application progress
- **Admin console** for organization-wide settings and team management

## Built for Collaboration

Unlike general-purpose ATS platforms that bolt on split-fee features as an afterthought, Splits Network was designed from the ground up for collaborative recruiting. Every workflow assumes multiple parties are involved, and permissions are scoped to ensure each participant sees exactly what they need.

## What's Next

Phase 2 development is underway, bringing integrated payment processing via Stripe Connect, an integrations marketplace, advanced analytics dashboards, and mobile applications.
