Today's release adds structured note-taking to the application workflow. Every decision point now captures context, so your team always knows the "why" behind each action.

## New Features

### Application Notes

You can now add notes to applications directly from the gate actions panel. When reviewing a candidate at any pipeline stage, leave notes that are visible to your team. These notes persist on the application record, creating a running commentary that helps the next reviewer understand previous feedback without asking around.

### Detailed Withdrawal Records

When an application is withdrawn, the system now records who initiated the withdrawal and when. Whether a candidate self-withdrew or a recruiter pulled the application, the record clearly indicates the source and includes any notes provided. This eliminates confusion when reviewing why a candidate dropped out of your pipeline.

## Improvements

### Streamlined Gate Actions

The gate review action buttons have been simplified. Labels are clearer, and the flow from reviewing to taking action requires fewer steps. The interface now focuses on the decisions you actually need to make at each stage.
