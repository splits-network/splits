We're starting the new year with a substantial release that touches nearly every corner of the platform. From a brand-new status page to smoother notifications and richer job details, here's what's new.

## New Features

### System Status Page

You can now check the health of every Splits Network service at a glance. The new status page shows real-time availability for the portal, candidate app, corporate site, and all backend services. If something goes down, you'll know immediately without guessing whether the issue is on your end or ours.

### Toast Notifications

Gone are the disruptive browser alerts. The platform now uses sleek toast notifications that slide in from the corner of your screen to confirm actions, surface errors, and deliver feedback. You stay in context instead of dismissing modal pop-ups.

### Job Proposal Emails for Recruiters

When a candidate applies through a job proposal, the assigned recruiter now receives an email notification automatically. You no longer need to check the dashboard constantly to know when a candidate has moved forward on a role you proposed.

### Internal Service Authentication

A new shared-secret authentication layer secures communication between platform services. This means your data is protected by an additional verification step as it moves through the system, adding defense in depth beyond user-level authentication.

### Enhanced Invitation Flow

The recruiter invitation experience now displays detailed recruiter information directly on the invitation page. If you arrive via a shared link, the platform preserves that URL through the sign-up process so you land in the right place after completing registration.

## Improvements

### Refreshed Email Design

Every email from Splits Network now features updated branding with a teal gradient design, dynamic logo, and white header. Whether it's an invitation, application update, or notification, emails look polished and are easier to scan.

### Richer Job and Role Cards

Job listings and role cards now display company details including industry, headquarters location, and company logo. Role lists show improved financial details so you can evaluate fee structures at a glance without clicking into each role.

### Smarter Application Handling

Creating an application now automatically resolves candidate IDs and processes pre-screen answers in one step. The system handles the lookup for you, reducing manual data entry and the chance of mismatched records.

### Improved Health Score Display

Health score metrics now use updated calculation logic and clearer visual indicators. At a glance, you can tell whether a metric is trending well or needs attention.

### Dashboard Navigation

The "Go to Home" button on invitation pages has been updated to "Go to Dashboard," taking you directly to your workspace instead of a generic landing page.

### Billing and Company Settings

The billing and company settings pages have been reorganized with a cleaner layout, making it easier to find subscription details, team management, and company profile information.
