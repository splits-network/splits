        question: "Is it really free for candidates?",
        answer: "Absolutely. You'll never pay a dime. Companies pay recruiters when they make a hire—that's how the platform works. Your job search is 100% free.",
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from LinkedIn or Indeed?",
        answer: "Instead of blasting applications into the void, you get matched with real recruiters who specialize in your field. They advocate for you, prep you for interviews, and keep you updated. It's like having an agent for your career.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will I actually hear back from companies?",
        answer: "That's the whole point. Recruiters on our platform are measured by responsiveness. You'll get status updates within 48 hours, and you'll never be left wondering where your application stands.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do recruiters find me?",
        answer: "You create a profile highlighting your skills, experience, and what you're looking for. Recruiters search our network for candidates who match their roles, and they'll reach out directly when there's a fit.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I control who sees my profile?",
        answer: "Yes. You decide your visibility settings and approve any company before they see your full details. Your current employer won't stumble across your profile unless you want them to.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I'm not actively looking but open to opportunities?",
        answer: "Perfect use case. Set your status to 'passively looking' and recruiters will only reach out for roles that are genuinely compelling. No spam, just relevant opportunities.",
    },
