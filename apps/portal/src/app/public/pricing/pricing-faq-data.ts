        question: "How do payout bonuses work?",
        answer: "When a placement is made, the company pays a placement fee (e.g., 20% of salary). Your subscription tier determines your payout bonus level. Higher tiers earn larger bonuses on successful placements. All payouts are finalized at hire time based on participation and role details.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I switch plans at any time?",
        answer: "Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately, and you'll be charged a prorated amount. Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I try Pro or Partner features before upgrading?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Start with our free Starter plan to explore the platform and make placements. When you're ready for higher payout bonuses and premium features, you can upgrade at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately.",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if I don't make any placements?",
        answer: "Your monthly subscription gives you access to the platform and roles, regardless of placements. You only earn when you successfully place candidates, but there's no penalty for quieter months.",
    },
    {
        question: "Are there any additional fees?",
        answer: "No hidden fees. The monthly subscription is your only recurring cost. All placement earnings follow the transparent split model—no surprise deductions.",
    },
