## 1. HERO SECTION

**Badge:** `JOIN THE TEAM`

**H1:** BUILD WHAT RECRUITING **DESERVES**

## 3. MISSION SECTION — "WHY WE EXIST"

**H2:** THE PROBLEM IS **INFRASTRUCTURE**

**Paragraph 1:**
Split-fee recruiting is a $4.7 billion market operating on handshakes and spreadsheets. Recruiters hoard job orders because the tools punish collaboration. Companies work with single agencies because there is no infrastructure to manage multiple partners transparently. Candidates get caught in the middle, represented by whoever reached them first instead of whoever represents them best.

**Paragraph 2:**
Splits Network exists to fix that. We built the platform that makes split-fee recruiting a first-class workflow — tracked, transparent, and profitable for everyone involved. Every interaction is visible. Every contribution is measured. Every payment is tied to a verified outcome.

**Paragraph 3:**
This is not an incremental improvement to existing recruiting software. This is new infrastructure for a model the industry has wanted for decades but never had the technology to support. We are a small team building something large, and we need people who see the same gap we do.

## 5. WHAT WE VALUE

### Value 1: SHIP IT
**Icon suggestion:** `fa-duotone fa-regular fa-rocket`
**Accent color:** coral
**Description:**
We deploy multiple times a day. We write tests, we review code, and we push to production. Perfection is a direction, not a destination. If it works and it is correct, it ships. If it needs iteration, it ships and then it improves.

### Value 2: TRANSPARENCY IS THE PRODUCT
**Icon suggestion:** `fa-duotone fa-regular fa-eye`
**Accent color:** teal
**Description:**
Our entire platform is built on the premise that visibility creates trust. We apply the same principle internally. Roadmaps are public. Metrics are shared. Decisions are documented. You will never wonder why something was built or why a direction changed.

### Value 3: OWN THE OUTCOME
**Icon suggestion:** `fa-duotone fa-regular fa-bullseye`
**Accent color:** yellow
**Description:**
We hire people who take responsibility for results, not just tasks. You will own features end to end — from problem definition through implementation, launch, and measurement. Nobody here waits for permission to solve a problem they can see.

### Value 4: BUILD FOR THE RECRUITER
**Icon suggestion:** `fa-duotone fa-regular fa-users`
**Accent color:** purple
**Description:**
Every decision gets filtered through one question: does this make the recruiter's day better? We talk to users constantly. We watch sessions. We read support tickets. The best product insights come from the people doing the work, not from conference rooms.

---

## 6. OPEN ROLES SECTION

**H2:** FIND YOUR **ROLE**

**Intro paragraph:**
We are looking for people who build with conviction. Engineers who care about the problem, not just the stack. Designers who think in systems. Operators who treat every process as a product. If you have shipped real software to real users and you want to do it at a company where your work reaches an entire industry — keep reading.

*(Dynamic job listings render below this intro)*

## 7. BENEFITS GRID

### Benefit 1: REMOTE-FIRST, NOT REMOTE-ALLOWED
**Icon suggestion:** `fa-duotone fa-regular fa-globe`
**Accent color:** coral
**Description:**
Every process, every meeting, every decision is built for distributed teams. No headquarters advantage. No timezone favoritism. Your work speaks — your location does not.

### Benefit 2: MEANINGFUL EQUITY
**Icon suggestion:** `fa-duotone fa-regular fa-chart-line`
**Accent color:** teal
**Description:**
Early-stage equity with transparent terms. You are building something — you should own a piece of it. We share the cap table context so you understand exactly what your grant means.

### Benefit 3: LEARNING BUDGET
**Icon suggestion:** `fa-duotone fa-regular fa-graduation-cap`
**Accent color:** yellow
**Description:**
$2,500 per year for conferences, courses, books, and tools. Spend it on whatever makes you better at your craft. No approval process, no justification forms.

### Benefit 4: UNLIMITED PTO (THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE)
**Icon suggestion:** `fa-duotone fa-regular fa-calendar-check`
**Accent color:** purple
**Description:**
We track minimum time off, not maximum. Leadership takes real vacations and expects you to do the same. Burnout does not ship features.

### Benefit 5: TOP-TIER EQUIPMENT
**Icon suggestion:** `fa-duotone fa-regular fa-laptop`
**Accent color:** coral
**Description:**
Pick your setup. MacBook Pro, standing desk, monitor, peripherals — whatever you need to do your best work. We ship it to your door.

### Benefit 6: HEALTH AND WELLNESS
**Icon suggestion:** `fa-duotone fa-regular fa-heart-pulse`
**Accent color:** teal
**Description:**
Full medical, dental, and vision coverage. Mental health support included. We invest in the people building the platform, not just the platform itself.

## 9. CTA SECTION

**H2:** THE INDUSTRY IS **MOVING**

**Subtitle:**
Split-fee recruiting is being rebuilt from the ground up. The teams that build this infrastructure will define how an entire industry operates for the next decade. We are hiring the people who want to be part of that.

# COPY AUDIT — EXISTING PUBLIC PAGES

## About Page (`apps/portal/src/app/public/about/page.tsx`)

### Hedge Words & Weak Language
- **Line 129:** "We're building the future of collaborative recruiting" — vague future-talk, no conviction.
- **Line 149-155:** "To create a transparent, fair marketplace where specialized recruiters and companies collaborate seamlessly on placements" — reads like a mission statement generator. "Collaborate seamlessly" is a cliche.
- **Line 165-171:** "A world where every specialized recruiter can build a sustainable business through split placements" — "a world where" is textbook hedge language. State what you are doing, not what you dream about.
- **Line 349:** "Be part of the platform that's changing how split placements work" — "changing" is vague. Changing how? Say it.

### Corporate Cliches
- **Line 59:** "We're constantly improving, listening to feedback, and building features that solve real problems." — Generic startup boilerplate. Every company says this. Cut it or make it specific.
- **Line 43-44:** "We're building more than a platform—we're creating a network of recruiters who support and collaborate with each other." — The "more than a [thing]" construction is overused. Just describe what the network does.
- **Line 83:** "Modern Technology Stack" as a value — reads like a job posting, not a brand differentiator. Every SaaS company claims modern tech.

### Voice Issues
- **Team Members section (lines 88-113):** Placeholder names ("Founder Name", "Tech Name") with generic bios. When these get real names, the descriptions need Designer Six voice — not "Passionate about building scalable platforms."
- **Core Values section:** Six values is too many. They blur together. Memphis version should pick 4 and make each one sharp.
- Overall tone is earnest but safe. No declarations. No enemy named. No data. Needs a full rewrite for Memphis.

## For Recruiters Page (`apps/portal/src/app/public/for-recruiters/page.tsx`)

### Hedge Words & Weak Language
- **Line 117-120:** "Join the largest network of collaborative recruiters. Increase your income, expand your reach, and build lasting professional relationships while placing top talent." — Triple comma list of vague promises. Pick one and drive it home.
- **Line 49:** "Scale your recruiting business on your terms. Work part-time or full-time, focus on your specialties, and grow at your pace." — "On your terms" and "at your pace" are filler phrases that say nothing specific.
- **Line 518:** "The future of recruiting is flexible" — hedge word "flexible" could mean anything.

### Corporate Cliches
- **Line 196-197:** "Why Choose Splits Network" — generic SaaS heading. Every competitor uses this exact phrase.
- **Line 200-202:** "We've built the most transparent, profitable, and collaborative recruiting platform in the industry." — Superlative claim with no backing data. Either prove it or reframe as a specific advantage.
- **Line 293:** "leverage diverse networks" — "leverage" is a banned word in Designer Six voice.
- **Line 386:** "Start Your Success Story" — marketing cliche. CTA should be action-oriented, not narrative.
- **Line 569:** "Ready to Transform Your Recruiting Business?" — "transform" is overused SaaS-speak. The Memphis version should state the specific outcome.

### Voice Issues
- Stats in the hero are good (2,500+, $85M+, 12k+) but they are not sourced or contextualized.
- The "Remote Work Freedom" section (lines 467-561) is bloated. Three paragraphs to say "work from anywhere." Memphis version needs one sharp section.
- Process steps are functional but lack personality. Each step reads like documentation, not conviction.

---

## For Companies Page (`apps/portal/src/app/public/for-companies/page.tsx`)

### Hedge Words & Weak Language
- **Line 9:** "Transform your hiring process with Splits Network's collaborative recruiting platform." — Metadata description uses "transform" (banned cliche).
- **Line 138:** "Transform your hiring with our collaborative recruiting network." — Same word, same problem. In the hero no less.

### Corporate Cliches
- **Line 783:** "Join over 1,200 companies who've revolutionized their recruiting process." — "Revolutionized" is the exact kind of word Designer Six never uses. State what changed with data.
- **Line 596-597:** "Why Choose Splits Network?" — Same generic heading as the recruiter page.
- **Line 220-221:** "Why Companies Choose Us" — And again.
- **Line 242-249:** "Transform Your Recruiting Business" heading — "Transform" for the third time on one page.

### Voice Issues
- The "What Your Company Actually Gets" section (lines 370-589) is strong in structure but verbose. Each benefit card runs 4-5 sentences when 2-3 would hit harder.
- The comparison section ("Collective Intelligence vs. Single Points of Failure") has the right framing but the copy is too long. Memphis version should use the coral/teal old-way-vs-new-way pattern with bullet points, not paragraphs.
- Good data points exist (14 days avg hire time, 50% cost reduction, 95% success rate) but they are scattered. Memphis version should consolidate them into a stats bar.
- Multiple CTA sections saying slightly different versions of the same thing. Memphis version gets one CTA section at the end. Make it count.

## Summary: Patterns to Fix Across All Pages

1. **"Transform" appears 5+ times** across the three pages — banned from Memphis versions
2. **"Why Choose [Brand]"** used as a heading on 2 pages — replace with declarations
3. **No enemy named** on any page — Memphis versions should call out the old way directly
4. **Stats exist but are not structured** — Memphis versions consolidate into 4-stat bars
5. **CTAs are passive** ("Ready to...?") — Memphis CTAs are imperative ("Post a Role", "Join the Network")
6. **Gradients and shadows throughout** — Memphis versions use flat colors, 4px borders, no shadows
7. **rounded-2xl, shadow-2xl, hover:shadow-lg** — all violations of Memphis formatting rules
8. **"leverage", "revolutionize", "transform", "seamlessly"** — all banned words still in active use
