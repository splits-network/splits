        question: "How do splits actually work on this platform?",
        answer: "A company posts a role with a placement fee (typically 15-25% of the candidate's salary). A recruiter submits a candidate. If that candidate gets hired, the fee is split: the recruiter receives 75%, the platform retains 25%. All terms are locked before the first submission. No renegotiation. No surprises.",
    },
    {
        question: "Who owns the candidate relationship?",
        answer: "The recruiter who submits the candidate owns that relationship. Full stop. The platform coordinates the placement process -- tracking, communication, payment -- but it never inserts itself between a recruiter and their candidate. Your relationships are yours.",
    },
    {
        question: "What does it cost to use Splits Network?",
        answer: "Recruiters choose a subscription tier based on their volume and needs. Companies post roles for free and pay only when a hire is made. The platform takes a transparent percentage of the placement fee. No hidden costs. No setup fees. No \"call us for pricing\" games.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to replace my existing ATS?",
        answer: "No. Splits Network runs alongside your current tools. Use it specifically for split placements while keeping your primary ATS for direct hires. This isn't a replacement -- it's infrastructure you didn't have before.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do payments work?",
        answer: "When a placement closes, the company pays the full placement fee through the platform. Splits Network automatically calculates each party's share and distributes funds to the recruiter. Every dollar is tracked. Every transaction is visible in your dashboard.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I bring my existing recruiting partners onto the platform?",
        answer: "Yes. Invite companies and recruiters you already work with. Post roles, collaborate with trusted partners, and manage all your split placements in one place. The platform makes your existing network more productive, not less relevant.",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if a placement falls through during the guarantee period?",
        answer: "Clawback terms are defined upfront in the role posting. If a placement falls through within the guarantee window, the platform handles the clawback calculation and adjustment automatically. Everyone sees the same terms from day one. No arguments. No ambiguity.",
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from a traditional recruiting marketplace?",
        answer: "Traditional marketplaces match candidates to jobs. Splits Network is infrastructure for the split-fee relationship itself. Every feature -- pipeline tracking, fee calculation, payment distribution, communication -- is designed around the reality that multiple parties are collaborating on a single placement. That distinction is the entire product.",
