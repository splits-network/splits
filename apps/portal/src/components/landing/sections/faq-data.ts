        question: "How do splits actually work on Splits Network?",
        answer: "When a candidate is hired, the company pays a placement fee (typically 15-25% of salary). The platform takes a small percentage, and the recruiter receives the majority of the fee. All terms are agreed upon upfront and tracked transparently in your dashboard.",
    },
    {
        question: "Who owns the candidate relationship?",
        answer: "You do. The recruiter who submits the candidate maintains their relationship. Splits Network coordinates the placement process, but recruiters own their candidate relationships and company connections.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do payments work?",
        answer: "Splits Network tracks placements and calculates splits automatically. Companies pay through the platform, and recruiters receive their share directly. All payment terms are transparent and agreed upon before any work begins.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I bring my existing network onto the platform?",
        answer: "Absolutely. You can invite companies and recruiters you already work with. Post roles, collaborate with trusted partners, and manage all your split placements in one place.",
    },
    {
        question: "What does it cost?",
        answer: "Recruiters choose a subscription tier based on their needs. Companies post roles for free and pay only when a hire is made. The platform takes a transparent percentage of the placement fee—no hidden costs.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to switch away from my current ATS?",
        answer: "No. Splits Network works alongside your existing systems. Use it specifically for split placements while keeping your primary ATS for direct hires and internal processes.",
    },
