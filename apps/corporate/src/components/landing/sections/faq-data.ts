        question: "What's the difference between Splits Network and Applicant Network?",
        answer: "Splits Network is our platform for recruiters and companies—where roles are posted, split-fee partnerships are managed, and placements happen. Applicant Network is our candidate-facing platform where job seekers apply, get matched with recruiters, and track their applications. Both platforms work together seamlessly.",
    },
    {
        question: "How much does it cost?",
        answer: "For candidates, Applicant Network is completely free—forever. For recruiters, Splits Network offers free and paid tiers depending on your needs. Companies pay recruiting fees only when a hire is made—no retainers or upfront costs.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do split fees work?",
        answer: "When a recruiter places a candidate at a company through our network, the placement fee is split according to pre-agreed terms visible to all parties. Typically the recruiter who sourced the candidate and the recruiter who brought the role each receive a portion of the fee.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is my data secure?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We use industry-standard encryption, secure authentication through Clerk, and strict access controls. Candidates control who sees their information, and all data is handled in compliance with privacy regulations.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I get started?",
        answer: "Candidates can create a free profile on Applicant Network in under 2 minutes. Recruiters can join Splits Network and start accessing roles immediately. Companies can post their first role and begin receiving candidates the same day.",
    },
    {
        question: "What makes Employment Networks different from other recruiting platforms?",
        answer: "We built both sides of the equation from the ground up. Instead of retrofitting candidate features onto a recruiter tool (or vice versa), we designed platforms that genuinely serve each audience while sharing data seamlessly. Transparency, real-time updates, and fair splits are built into everything we do.",
    },
