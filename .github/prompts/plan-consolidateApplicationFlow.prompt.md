# Plan: Consolidate Application Flow - Deprecate Candidate Role Assignments

## Problem Statement

Currently, we have two parallel state machines tracking candidate-job pairings:

1. **Applications** - Track candidate submission workflow (draft → ai_review → submitted)
2. **Candidate Role Assignments (CRAs)** - Track marketplace deals and company review gates

This creates:
- Duplicate state tracking (application.stage ↔ CRA.state)
- Synchronization complexity (keeping both in sync)
- Confusing mental model (when to use which?)
- Potential for data inconsistency
- Unnecessary complexity for direct candidate-company relationships (no recruiters)

## Core Insight

**Applications + referential data capture all necessary relationships:**
- **Direct on applications**: candidate_id, job_id, candidate_recruiter_id (represents candidate)
- **Via job table**: company_recruiter_id, job_owner_recruiter_id
- **Via candidate_sourcers table**: candidate_sourcer_id
- **Via company_sourcers table**: company_sourcer_id

**Key Point**: We don't need to duplicate this data on applications - we can fetch it via JOINs when needed (e.g., during placement creation)

**When a candidate is hired:**
1. Application.stage → 'hired'
2. Create placement record (snapshot all role IDs from related records)
3. Create placement_splits for each non-null role
4. Generate payouts based on splits

**CRAs are redundant** - they track the same relationships with a parallel state machine.

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Clarify Applications Schema

Rename `recruiter_id` to `candidate_recruiter_id` for absolute clarity:

```sql
-- Rename for clarity (existing field, just renaming)
ALTER TABLE applications
RENAME COLUMN recruiter_id TO candidate_recruiter_id;

-- Note: We don't need to add company_recruiter_id, proposed_by, etc.
-- These can be obtained through referential data:
-- - company_recruiter_id: via job.company_recruiter_id (if exists)
-- - candidate_sourcer_id: via candidate_sourcers table
-- - company_sourcer_id: via company_sourcers table
-- - job_owner_recruiter_id: via job.job_owner_recruiter_id
```

### Phase 2: Expand Application Stages

Update ApplicationStage type to handle full lifecycle including company review:

```typescript
export type ApplicationStage =
    // Candidate self-service stages
    | 'draft'              // Candidate working on application
    | 'ai_review'          // AI analyzing fit
    | 'ai_reviewed'        // AI review complete, awaiting candidate action
    
    // Recruiter involvement stages
    | 'recruiter_request'  // Recruiter requested more details from candidate (should also contain notes that are appended to recruiter_notes)
    | 'recruiter_proposed' // Recruiter proposed candidate to job (should also include notes that are appended to recruiter_notes)
    | 'recruiter_review'   // Recruiter reviewing before submission
    
    // Company review stages (replaces CRA gates)
    | 'screen'             // Initial screen phase if no company recruiter, it will be shown to company and prompted for engaging a recruiter for screening
    | 'submitted'          // Submitted to company
    | 'company_review'     // Company reviewing candidate, now company can see candidate details
    | 'company_feedback'   // Company provided feedback, awaiting next action.  (if company recruiter assigned, they handle feedback, if not recruiter assigned to job handles feedback, if none assigned, candidate notified directly)
    | 'interview'          // Interview scheduled/in-progress
    | 'offer'              // Offer extended
    
    // Terminal states
    | 'hired'              // Candidate hired → create placement
    | 'rejected'           // Company/recruiter rejected
    | 'withdrawn'          // Candidate withdrew
    | 'expired';           // Timed out without action
```

### Phase 3: Update Application Interface

```typescript
export interface Application {
    id: string;
    candidate_id: string;
    job_id: string;
    stage: ApplicationStage;  // Now includes full lifecycle stages
    
    // Recruiter assignment (optional - represents candidate)
    candidate_recruiter_id?: string | null;  // Renamed from recruiter_id for clarity
    
    // Note: Other recruiter roles obtained via referential data:
    // - company_recruiter_id: via job.company_recruiter_id
    // - candidate_sourcer_id: via candidate_sourcers.sourcer_recruiter_id
    // - company_sourcer_id: via company_sourcers.sourcer_recruiter_id  
    // - job_owner_recruiter_id: via job.job_owner_recruiter_id
    
    // Submission tracking
    submitted_at?: Date | null;
    
    // Hire tracking
    hired_at?: Date | null;
    placement_id?: string | null;
    
    // Application content
    salary?: number | null;
    cover_letter?: string | null;
    recruiter_notes?: string | null;
    internal_notes?: string | null;
    
    // Timestamps
    created_at: Date;
    updated_at: Date;
}
```

### Phase 4: Update Placement Creation Logic

When application.stage → 'hired', create placement with snapshot from referential data:

```typescript
async function createPlacementFromApplication(applicationId: string) {
    // Get application with all related data
    const application = await getApplicationWithRelations(applicationId);
    const candidate = await getCandidate(application.candidate_id);
    const job = await getJob(application.job_id);
    const company = await getCompany(job.company_id);
    
    // Get all recruiter role IDs from referential data (all nullable)
    const candidateRecruiterId = application.candidate_recruiter_id;  // From application
    const companyRecruiterId = job.company_recruiter_id;              // From job
    const jobOwnerRecruiterId = job.job_owner_recruiter_id;           // From job
    
    // Get sourcer IDs from dedicated tables (all nullable)
    const candidateSourcer = await getCandidateSourcer(candidate.id);
    const companySourcer = await getCompanySourcer(company.id);
    
    // Create placement snapshot with all 5 roles
    const placement = await createPlacement({
        application_id: application.id,
        candidate_id: application.candidate_id,
        job_id: application.job_id,
        
        // Snapshot all role IDs from referential data (all nullable)
        candidate_recruiter_id: candidateRecruiterId,
        company_recruiter_id: companyRecruiterId,
        job_owner_recruiter_id: jobOwnerRecruiterId,
        candidate_sourcer_id: candidateSourcer?.sourcer_recruiter_id,
        company_sourcer_id: companySourcer?.sourcer_recruiter_id,
        
        // Money details
        salary: application.salary,
        fee_percentage: job.fee_percentage,
        placement_fee: calculatePlacementFee(application.salary, job.fee_percentage),
        
        state: 'active',
        start_date: application.start_date,
    });
    
    // Create placement splits for each non-null role
    await createPlacementSplits(placement);
    
    // Update application
    await updateApplication(application.id, {
        stage: 'hired',
        hired_at: new Date(),
        placement_id: placement.id,
    });
    
    return placement;
}
```

### Phase 5: Migration Strategy

**Step 1: Schema Updates**
```sql
-- Rename recruiter_id to candidate_recruiter_id for clarity
ALTER TABLE applications
RENAME COLUMN recruiter_id TO candidate_recruiter_id;
```

**Step 2: Data Migration**
```sql
-- Migrate CRA candidate_recruiter_id to applications (if not already set)
UPDATE applications a
SET candidate_recruiter_id = cra.candidate_recruiter_id
FROM candidate_role_assignments cra
WHERE a.candidate_id = cra.candidate_id
  AND a.job_id = cra.job_id
  AND a.candidate_recruiter_id IS NULL
  AND cra.candidate_recruiter_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Map CRA states to application stages
UPDATE applications a
SET stage = CASE cra.state
    WHEN 'proposed' THEN 'recruiter_proposed'
    WHEN 'accepted' THEN 'company_review'
    WHEN 'interview' THEN 'interview'
    WHEN 'offer' THEN 'offer'
    WHEN 'hired' THEN 'hired'
    WHEN 'rejected' THEN 'rejected'
    WHEN 'declined' THEN 'rejected'
    WHEN 'withdrawn' THEN 'withdrawn'
    ELSE a.stage
END
FROM candidate_role_assignments cra
WHERE a.candidate_id = cra.candidate_id
  AND a.job_id = cra.job_id;

-- Note: We don't need to migrate company_recruiter_id, sourcer IDs, etc.
-- These are obtained via referential data (jobs table, sourcer tables)
```

**Step 3: Update Backend Services**

1. **ATS Service** - Update applications repository/service
   - Rename recruiter_id to candidate_recruiter_id throughout
   - Handle stage transitions including new company review stages
   - Ensure stage transitions respect new workflow (draft → screen → company_review → company_feedback → interview → offer → hired)

2. **Network Service** - Remove CRA endpoints
   - Migrate proposal logic to applications
   - Update recruiter dashboard to use applications
   - Remove CRA-specific queries

3. **Billing Service** - Update placement creation
   - Get recruiter IDs from referential data (not stored on applications)
   - candidate_recruiter_id: from application.candidate_recruiter_id
   - company_recruiter_id: from job.company_recruiter_id
   - job_owner_recruiter_id: from job.job_owner_recruiter_id
   - candidate_sourcer_id: from candidate_sourcers table
   - company_sourcer_id: from company_sourcers table
   - Snapshot all 5 role IDs when creating placement

**Step 4: Update Frontend**

1. **Portal App** - Update recruiter workflows
   - Update any references to recruiter_id → candidate_recruiter_id
   - Dashboard shows applications (not CRAs)
   - Company review flows use new application stages (company_review, company_feedback)
   - Handle new stage descriptions and routing logic

2. **Candidate App** - Minimal changes
   - Update any references to recruiter_id → candidate_recruiter_id
   - Already application-centric, so mostly nomenclature updates

**Step 5: Full Cleanup Phase** 

After confirming migration success and running production for 2+ weeks:

```sql
-- Database cleanup
DROP TABLE candidate_role_assignments CASCADE;

-- Remove any orphaned indexes or constraints
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_candidate_role_assignments_candidate_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_candidate_role_assignments_job_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_candidate_role_assignments_recruiter_id;
```

**Code Cleanup:**

1. **Network Service**:
   - Remove CRA endpoints: `/v2/candidate-role-assignments/*`
   - Remove `CandidateRoleAssignmentRepository`
   - Remove `CandidateRoleAssignmentService`
   - Remove CRA-related route handlers

2. **Shared Types**:
   - Remove `CandidateRoleAssignment` interface
   - Remove `CRAState` type
   - Remove CRA-related filter/update types
   - Remove CRA-related enums

3. **API Gateway**:
   - Remove CRA proxy routes
   - Remove CRA-related RBAC mappings
   - Clean up any CRA-specific middleware

4. **Frontend Apps**:
   - Remove CRA API client methods
   - Remove CRA-related components (if any)
   - Remove CRA-related types from frontend

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update API documentation (remove CRA endpoints)
   - Update architecture diagrams
   - Update AGENTS.md (remove CRA references)
   - Archive or update CRA-related guidance docs

6. **Testing**:
   - Remove CRA-related test files
   - Update integration tests (remove CRA assertions)
   - Remove CRA mock data and fixtures

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth** - Applications track entire candidate-job lifecycle
2. **Simpler Mental Model** - One flow from draft → hired
3. **No Synchronization** - No duplicate state to keep in sync
4. **Works for All Scenarios**:
   - Direct candidates (no recruiters)
   - Recruiter-represented candidates
   - Direct companies (no recruiters)
   - Recruiter-sourced companies
5. **Clear Money Attribution** - Placement snapshot grabs all role IDs from related records
6. **Reduced Complexity** - Fewer tables, fewer state machines, fewer potential errors

## Tradeoffs

1. **Lose Separate "Proposal" Concept**
   - Solution: Use application.stage = 'recruiter_proposed' + proposed_by field
   - Still tracks who initiated the relationship

2. **Company Gates Become Application Stages**
   - Solution: company_review, interview, offer stages handle this
   - Simpler than separate gate system

3. **Migration Effort**
   - Need to migrate existing CRA data to applications
   - Need to update all services and frontends
   - But pays off in long-term simplicity

## Success Criteria

1. All candidate-job pairings tracked via applications only
2. Recruiter assignments properly captured on applications
3. Placement creation correctly snapshots all 5 roles
4. Payout splits generated correctly for all role combinations
5. No data loss from CRA migration
6. Simpler codebase with fewer tables and state machines
7. Zero downtime during migration

## Open Questions

1. **Should we preserve CRA history?**
   - Option A: Keep CRA table read-only for historical reference
   - Option B: Migrate all data and drop table completely
   - Recommendation: Migrate fully, CRA data lives in applications now
   - Answer: migrate fully, drop CRA table

2. **How to handle in-flight CRAs during migration?**
   - Run migration during low-traffic window
   - Lock tables during migration
   - Test rollback procedure
   - Answer: we are not in production yet, so can do a straightforward migration

3. **Should application.stage be more granular?**
   - Could add more company review sub-stages
   - Keep simple for now, can extend later
   - Answer: keep as proposed for now

4. **What about gate routing logic?**
   - Gate review determines if candidate_recruiter or company_recruiter reviews
   - This becomes: "who should review at this stage?"
   - Can use application.candidate_recruiter_id and application.company_recruiter_id to route
   - i think that we should define that logic in the application service much like we do for candidate role assignments today with the validTransitions map
