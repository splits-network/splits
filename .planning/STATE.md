### Decisions

| ID | Phase | Decision | Impact |
|----|-------|----------|--------|
| client-server-split | 01-01 | Use server wrapper pattern for pricing page (metadata in server component, animations in client component) | Clean separation of concerns, maintains SEO, enables client-side animations |
| animation-scope | 01-01 | Animate only hero section in Phase 1 (full animations in Phase 2) | Validates infrastructure without scope creep; Phase 2 can build on proven foundation |
| default-fee | 03-01 | Default placement fee $20k, default role candidate_recruiter | Realistic example for most common use case |
| tier-naming | 03-01 | Tier names: Starter/Pro/Partner | Matches marketing terminology |
