On Applicant Network, every candidate created a profile specifically to be found by recruiters — and set their preferences for the kind of roles they want."

        {
          "question": "Can I post roles directly on the platform?",

          "question": "What does the split-fee integration mean for me?",
          "answer": "If you specialize in a particular niche, you can submit candidates to open split-fee roles posted by other recruiters — and earn a portion of the placement fee. Applicant Network is your candidate source; Splits Network is where those candidates get matched to opportunities."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I know a candidate is actually interested in moving?",
