        },
        {
          "question": "Who sets the total placement fee percentage?",
          "answer": "The hiring company sets the total placement fee — typically 15–25% of first-year salary — when they post the role. The recruiter managing the role then sets the split ratio. The candidate-owning recruiter sees both figures before submitting."

        {
          "question": "What happens if my candidate is submitted to the same role by another recruiter?",
          "answer": "If a candidate is submitted by two different recruiters, the first valid submission takes precedence. The platform timestamps every submission and flags potential conflicts. This is visible to the hiring company, who makes the final determination on which submission is active."

        {
          "question": "Can I use Splits Network for direct placements, not just splits?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How does the platform handle international splits?",
          "answer": "Splits Network supports international payments through Stripe. Currency conversion and international transfer fees apply. All amounts are displayed in USD on the platform; local currency conversion is handled by Stripe at the time of transfer."
