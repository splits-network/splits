        "Traditional recruiting operates on verbal agreements, relationship capital, and institutional memory. When disputes arise — over fee amounts, candidate ownership, or guarantee terms — there's often no authoritative record. The result is friction, missed payments, and damaged relationships.",
        "For independent recruiters, the stakes are higher. They're working on contingency, and if the terms aren't in writing and verified by a system, they're vulnerable. Hiring companies face the same problem in reverse: they have no visibility into how their roles are being worked, who's been submitted, or where a candidate stands at any given moment.",
