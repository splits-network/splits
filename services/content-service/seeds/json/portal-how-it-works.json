        "In traditional recruiting, a single agency owns the relationship with both the company and the candidate. They collect the full placement fee. Split-fee recruiting changes that dynamic: the hiring company posts a role, any qualified recruiter can engage, and when a placement is made, the fee is divided between the job-posting party and the placing recruiter.",
        "The result is broader candidate coverage for companies, access to more roles for recruiters, and a marketplace where specialization is rewarded. <strong>Everyone earns based on their contribution.</strong> Splits Network is the platform that makes this model operationally viable — handling agreements, pipelines, and payments in one place."
